{"title": "Post Office accused of wasting \u00a3136m on Horizon lawyers", "description": "Legal fees amount to more than one quarter of total paid to victims of scandal", "maintext": "The Post Office has been accused of wasting millions of pounds on lawyers involved in a much-delayed compensation scheme for victims of the Horizon scandal.\nA total of \u00a3136m has been spent on legal fees relating to redress schemes for Horizon, a bug-ridden IT system that resulted in a string of sub-postmasters wrongly being jailed for fraud.\nThis is equivalent to more than one-quarter of the \u00a3499m so far paid out to victims, according to MPs on the Business and Trade Committee. A total of \u00a382m has gone to just one law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills.\nAt the same time thousands of sub-postmasters are yet to receive the compensation they are owed and less than one third of the \u00a31.8bn allocated has so far been paid out due to an arduous claims process, said Liam Byrne, chairman of the Committee.\nHe said: \u201cYears on from the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, thousands of Post Office Horizon victims still don\u2019t have the redress to which they\u2019re entitled for the shatter and ruin of their lives.\n\u201cOurs is a nation that believes in fair play and the rule of law. Yet victims told us that seeking the redress to which they are entitled is akin to a second trial. Payments are so slow that people are dying before they get justice.\n\u201cBut the lawyers are walking away with millions. This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\nThe MPs on the Business and Trade Committee called for the Government to take over the handling of all compensation schemes instead of leaving some of them in the hands of the Post Office.\nThey also demanded a simpler and quicker system, criticising \u201cthe gold-plated legalistic process\u201d used currently which places an enormous administrative burden on victims.\nThe committee said: \u201cSwift action must be taken to deal with the thousands of claimants who still have not been given the redress that is owed to them. Sub-postmasters do not want Post Office Ltd to deal with redress and neither does Post Office Ltd itself.\n\u201cPost Office Ltd should not be deciding on what financial redress is owed to victims of its own scandal. The Government must finish the job in hand and remove Post Office Ltd from the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.\u201d\nThe committee also said hard deadlines should be imposed to pay claims, with extra compensation given to victims if these are missed.\nMr Byrne said: \u201cThe new Government has made important improvements. Payments are faster and the redress scheme is at last fully funded with more money.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t go on like this. Justice delayed is justice denied. So today, we\u2019re setting out a practical, common-sense plan to reboot the redress system.\n\u201cVictims should have upfront legal advice to help make sure they get what\u2019s fair. We need hard deadlines for government lawyers to approve the claims with financial penalties for taking too long. Crucially, we need the Post Office, which caused this scandal in the first place, taken out of the picture.\u201d\nThe Post Office said much of the legal bill was incurred in setting up the compensation schemes.\nA spokesman said: \u201cWorking alongside government, we are focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible. The Government\u2019s introduction of fixed-sum options without the need for postmasters to submit formal claims has helped greatly in accelerating settlements.\n\u201cOur spend with external law firms is kept under constant review with a significant portion having been spent on establishing the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and Overturned Convictions redress process, thus enabling us to pay redress to victims of the scandal.\n\u201cOur Chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the Government and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter.\u201d\nOther schemes are run by the Government. They are the group litigation scheme, which as of November had only fully paid out 47pc of claims, and the convictions redress scheme, which is still struggling to contact several dozen individuals whose convictions have been quashed.\nA government spokesman said: \u201cSince entering government, we have worked tirelessly to speed up the process of providing the victims of the Horizon Scandal with full and fair redress including by launching the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme earlier this year.\n\u201cWe are settling claims at a faster rate than ever before with the amount of redress paid doubling since July, with almost \u00a3500m being paid to over 3,300 claimants as of the end of November. We will respond to the Committee\u2019s report in due course.\u201d\nHerbert Smith Freehills said it has \u201cimmense sympathy\u201d for the victims.\nA spokesman said: \u201cHerbert Smith Freehills\u2019 work has been complex and wide-ranging, involving hundreds of our staff over several years.\n\u201cWe are confident that our fee levels are in line with norms for highly complex matters such as this.\u201d", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/post-office-accused-wasting-136m-horizon-lawyers/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 07:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:20+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Which law firm will have been paid \u00a382 million in legal fees by the Post Office for Horizon scandal redress schemes by the end of 2024?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 1st December 2024.

The article, however, is written in the past tense, discussing events and figures up to the point of its publication. The question's tense is not a direct match with the article's tense, but it is not necessarily incorrect because it projects into the future from the article's perspective. However, the critical aspect is whether the information in the article supports the future projection.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article directly states that \"A total of \u00a382m has gone to just one law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills.\" This information directly supports the answer to the question, as it identifies Herbert Smith Freehills as the law firm that has been paid \u00a382 million. The question's future perfect tense implies a continuation or completion of a process, but the article already confirms the payment.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer, \"Herbert Smith Freehills,\" is a specific and well-defined name of a law firm. It is not a phrase and consists of more than three words, but it is still considered concrete and specific. However, the criteria specify that the answer should not be more than 3 words. The answer provided is 3 words, which technically meets the \"not more than 3 words\" criteria if we count the words as separate entities.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer is not numeric; it is the name of a law firm.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The article clearly states that \u00a382m has gone to \"just one law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills.\" This indicates there is only one correct answer to the question, which is Herbert Smith Freehills.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The article directly supports the answer.\n- The answer is specific and the name of a law firm.\n- The answer is not numeric.\n- There is a single correct answer.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the question is about a future condition relative to the article's publication date, and the article does not directly confirm the state of affairs \"by the end of 2024.\" The article's information is current up to its publication, and it does not provide a projection or guarantee that the situation will remain the same by the end of 2024.\n\nDespite this, based on the information given and focusing strictly on the criteria:\n\n- The question's tense is future-oriented but is based on a fact stated in the article.\n- The answer is directly supported by the article.\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- There is a single correct answer according to the article.\n\nTherefore, considering the direct information provided by the article and the specifics of the question, the validation should focus on whether the article supports the core of the question.\n\nThe final validation check returns <answer>1</answer> because the article directly supports the answer \"Herbert Smith Freehills\" as the law firm paid \u00a382 million, and it meets the other specified criteria upon a detailed review. \n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer, let's analyze the components and criteria step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a future event (January 2025 report) and is stated in the future tense. This is acceptable as per the given criteria.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that \"The MPs on the Business and Trade Committee called for the Government to take over the handling of all compensation schemes instead of leaving some of them in the hands of the Post Office.\" This indicates that the committee is recommending the Government to take over. Thus, the answer can be derived from the article.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"the Government.\" It is short (2 words), concrete, and well-defined. However, the more precise entity name would be \"Government\" as commonly used in such contexts.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"the Government\" is not numeric; hence, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific entity. The article supports that the Business and Trade Committee is recommending the Government to take over. There's no indication of multiple correct answers.\n\nLet's examine the article's content relevant to the answer:\n- The article quotes Liam Byrne, chairman of the Committee, saying, \"Post Office Ltd should not be deciding on what financial redress is owed to victims of its own scandal. The Government must finish the job in hand and remove Post Office Ltd from the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.\u201d\n- The committee's statement directly calls for the Government to take over, supporting the answer \"the Government.\"\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The question is about a recommendation to be made in the future (January 2025), but the article already contains the committee's current stance, which is to recommend the Government to take over.\n- The answer \"the Government\" is supported by the article.\n- It is well-defined and not numeric.\n- There's a single correct answer based on the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, the validation checks pass.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question, let's go through each segment of the question and the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** As of November 2024, which Horizon scandal redress scheme will still be struggling to contact several dozen individuals whose convictions have been quashed?\n   - **Background:** The question pertains to the status of redress schemes for victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal as of November 2024.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on public reports or official statements regarding the status of these schemes. The resolution date is expected to be late 2024 or early 2025. The answer should be the name of the redress scheme.\n   - **Answer:** \"the convictions redress scheme\"\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in the future tense (\"will still be struggling\"), but it refers to a specific point in time (November 2024). However, the article is written in a way that suggests it is discussing the situation up to a certain point in time (mentioning \"as of November\"). The actual date of the article or the events isn't explicitly stated as being in 2024, which could be a point of contention. The article does mention \"as of November,\" which implies a specific timeframe but doesn't specify the year. Assuming the context is about a recent November, the tense might be considered acceptable if we infer the article's timeframe is relevant.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article states, \"Other schemes are run by the Government. They are the group litigation scheme, which as of November had only fully paid out 47pc of claims, and the convictions redress scheme, which is still struggling to contact several dozen individuals whose convictions have been quashed.\" This directly answers the question by identifying \"the convictions redress scheme\" as the scheme still struggling to contact individuals. Thus, the answer is sound and clear in the article.\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"the convictions redress scheme\" is more than three words and is a phrase, not a single word or a very short answer. However, it directly answers the question and is specific.\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a name/scheme, so it passes this criterion.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The article clearly identifies one scheme (\"the convictions redress scheme\") as struggling to contact individuals whose convictions were quashed. Thus, there's a single correct answer based on the information given.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The question's tense refers to a future state (\"will still be struggling\") relative to some unspecified current or past time. The article, however, discusses the situation \"as of November,\" which could be interpreted as providing a snapshot that could be relevant depending on the year.\n   - The answer is directly supported by the article.\n   - The answer is a phrase, not a single word or very short, which might be considered not well-defined under the strict criteria of being not more than 3 words.\n   - The answer type is string (name of scheme), which matches the expected format.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question's future tense might be slightly at odds with the article's presentation, but the key information is present.\n   - The answer is directly supported by the article.\n   - The answer is a phrase and exceeds the 3-word limit, failing the \"Well-defined Answer\" criterion.\n\nGiven the failure to meet the \"Well-defined Answer\" criterion due to the answer being more than 3 words, the response should be:\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question based on the given criteria, let's analyze each question one by one.\n\n### Analysis of Question 0\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about which law firm will have been paid \u00a382 million in legal fees by the end of 2024. The resolution date is early 2025, and the start date is implied to be in the future (1st December 2024), making it forward-looking. The time horizon is at least a day, so it's valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense; it's forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific law firm, implying a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to those following the Post Office Horizon scandal and legal fees, which is a significant public interest issue.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is not binary or multiple choice; it requires the name of a law firm.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable, with sufficient details about the context and the required answer.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer provided is \"Herbert Smith Freehills,\" which is definite and not vague.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the entity the Business and Trade Committee will recommend to take over the handling of all Horizon scandal compensation schemes in its January 2025 report. The start date is 15th December 2024, and the resolution date is January 2025, making it forward-looking and valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense; it's forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific entity, implying a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to those affected by the Horizon scandal and compensation schemes, which is a significant public interest issue.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is not binary or multiple choice; it requires the name of an entity.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable, with sufficient details about the context and the required answer.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer provided is \"the Government,\" which is definite and not vague.\n\n### Comparison\nBoth questions meet the criteria:\n- They are forward-looking and valid for forecasting.\n- Not stated in the past tense.\n- Imply a single correct answer.\n- Are relevant to a significant public interest issue.\n- Are not binary or multiple choice questions.\n- Are understandable with sufficient details.\n- Have definite answers.\n\nTo choose between them, we consider the **Impact**:\n- Question 0 is about the law firm paid \u00a382 million in legal fees, relevant to those following the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n- Question 1 is about the entity recommended to take over the handling of compensation schemes, relevant to those affected by the Horizon scandal and potentially a broader audience due to its implications on the handling of the scandal.\n\nBoth questions have significant impact, but **Question 1** might have a broader impact because it involves a recommendation on the handling of compensation schemes, potentially affecting more people directly (those awaiting compensation) and influencing the future management of the scandal.\n\n### Output\nGiven that both questions are valid and have significant impact, but considering the slightly broader implications of **Question 1**, the output will be based on **Question 1**.\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>Which entity will the Business and Trade Committee recommend to take over the handling of all Horizon scandal compensation schemes in its January 2025 report?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The phrase \"e.g., a government department or body\" is somewhat generic but is close to the actual answer as it hints at a governmental entity.

{"title": "Manchester United\u2019s lily-livered players lack the fight Ruben Amorim demands", "description": "Mediocrity has lasted so long at the club that it is now blithely accepted \u2013 in a scenario where relegation looms, that is a major problem", "maintext": "Players are trading on past feats, and few more so than Lisandro Mart\u00ednez. Remember when this World Cup winner was acclaimed as the defensive linchpin United needed?\nThat portrayal felt a distant memory on the evidence of United\u2019s first-half capitulation against Newcastle, with his lack of height and poor positioning crucial factors in both goals. On the one night he needed to summon some leadership, stepping up as captain in place of the suspended Bruno Fernandes, he was as lily-livered as the rest. Despite revelling in a reputation as \u201cthe butcher\u201d, the moniker he brought with him from Ajax, he left his team ripe for a filleting.\nWhile United\u2019s torpor has become a tailspin, the question is who on the pitch has the gumption to stop it. Fernandes? Too reckless. Mart\u00ednez? Too error-prone. Rasmus Hojlund? Too toothless.\nThere is the awkward question, too, of how much these players truly care about the club\u2019s desperate predicament. Take Casemiro, for example. The Brazilian is emblematic of the worst United side in living memory, his CV decorated with five Champions League titles but his body language suggesting he regards his latest club as a form of lucrative semi-retirement.\nAs soon as he is spared international duty, he disappears to Disneyland. In defence or midfield, he has proved similarly ineffectual, embarrassing himself in the Newcastle defeat with a shot that almost sprang a fresh leak in Old Trafford\u2019s rickety roof.\nIn a situation as parlous as this, players are judged by their character, by whether they strain every sinew in pursuit of every loose ball. United fans look in vain for anybody who fits the description.\nAmorim is forced to start with Hojlund \u2013 absurdly overpriced on his five-year, \u00a372 million deal \u2013 only to castigate the Dane after seven minutes when he neglects to push up high enough. And when he seeks a breakthrough at 2-0 down, the manager must turn to Antony, a diagram of indolence who has not scored this season. He could be forgiven for re-examining the prospectus on which he was brought to United. It should be impossible for an institution to spend \u00a31.8 billion on players in 11 years and produce a team so feeble.\nIt is surely no coincidence that the one player with a link to the Ferguson era is the one who still exhibits an elite perspective. Jonny Evans might no longer be the centre-back he was in his first United spell, when he won the league three times, but he still knows how to articulate the weight of expectation that accompanies the shirt. \u201cI have a long affiliation with this club, and the pressures that come with it,\u201d he said in October, as Ten Hag neared the brink. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of it, it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d\nThose without Evans\u2019 United pedigree struggle to muster the same emotion or allegiance. Whether it is an over-the-hill Casemiro or the pitiful Antony, a sense forms of individuals who are simply passing through.\nThe mediocrity has lasted so long that it is now blithely accepted. And in a scenario where relegation looms, that is a major problem, with a side so accustomed to ordinariness that they lose the heart to aspire to anything else. It should be a clarion call, this plea by Amorim to \u201cfight\u201d. But he sounded as if he were blind to the bleakest reality of all \u2013 the fact that any fight in these players left long ago.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2025/01/01/manchester-united-players-lack-fight-ruben-amorim-needs/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 07:17:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:26+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Which English Premier League club will be managed by Ruben Amorim at the end of the 2024-2025 season?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The article is written in the present or past tense, discussing the current situation with Manchester United and Ruben Amorim. The question's future tense is not directly addressed by the article since it doesn't predict future managerial appointments. Thus, the question is not directly answerable based on the information given in the article.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article discusses Ruben Amorim's current managerial role and the performance of Manchester United under his management or the lack thereof. However, it does not confirm whether he will be managing Manchester United at the end of the 2024-2025 season. The resolution criteria mention that the answer should be based on the official managerial appointment listed on the Premier League's official website or a formal announcement from the club.

However, the article does not provide information about future managerial appointments or confirm that Ruben Amorim will still be managing Manchester United.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The article does not directly or indirectly confirm that Ruben Amorim will be managing Manchester United at the end of the 2024-2025 season. The question is about a future event not covered by the article.\n- The answer \"Manchester United\" is based on the current situation described in the article, not on a definitive statement about the future.\n\nTherefore, the criteria that are not met are:\n- **Tense and Details**: The question is about the future, and the article does not provide a direct answer.\n- **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article does not resolve the question definitively.\n\nSince the question's answer cannot be definitively resolved by the article and involves speculation about the future, the validation fails.\n\nThe final answer is <answer>0</answer>.", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To evaluate the given question and its answer based on the provided article, let's analyze the task step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about the final league position of Manchester United in the 2024-2025 Premier League season. The article, however, discusses Manchester United's performance in a context that implies the current season is not yet concluded, and it criticizes the team's performance. The question is in the future tense relative to the article's context, which seems to be discussing the team's situation in the current or a very recent season. The article does not directly address the 2024-2025 season. Thus, the question's tense is future relative to the article's implied timeframe.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article discusses Manchester United's poor performance and mentions the threat of relegation but does not provide a definitive answer to Manchester United's final league position in the 2024-2025 season. The article's content is about the team's current or recent performance issues and does not specifically address the 2024-2025 season. Therefore, the article does not resolve the question definitely.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"Relegation,\" which is not an ordinal position but rather a status that could result from a specific range of final league positions (e.g., 18th, 19th, or 20th in a 20-team league). The accepted answer format requires an ordinal number.

However, it does not fit the specified format of an ordinal position.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific ordinal position. \"Relegation\" could correspond to multiple positions (18th, 19th, 20th), so it's not a single, specific answer.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- The question is about a future season relative to the article's context, and the article does not directly address the 2024-2025 season.\n- The article does not provide a definitive answer to the question.\n- The answer \"Relegation\" is not in the required ordinal format and could imply multiple possible positions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is not valid based on the criteria.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid by being faithful to the article, let's go through each segment of the question and the criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question is about predicting the competition in which Antony will score his first goal during the 2024-2025 season.\n   - **Background:** Antony is a forward for Manchester United and has not scored in the 2024-2025 season as of December 25, 2024.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer will be based on the first official match report that credits Antony with a goal. The accepted answer format is the full, official name of the competition.\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a future event (Antony scoring a goal in the 2024-2025 season). The article is written in a past tense context, discussing events that have already happened. Thus, it doesn't directly address future events or predictions about the 2024-2025 season. **This indicates a potential issue because the article's context is different from the question's future-oriented nature.**\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article discusses Antony's current performance and mentions that he has not scored this season.

However, the article does not provide any basis for determining this. If Antony does not score, \"None\" could be considered correct, but this is speculative based on the article's information.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article criticizes Antony's performance, stating he has not scored this season and is described as a \"diagram of indolence.\" However, it does not provide any insight into future performances or the competitions Manchester United will participate in during the 2024-2025 season.\n   - The question is about a future event (the competition in which Antony will score his first goal), and the article discusses past performances.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question is about a future event not directly addressed by the article.\n   - The article does not provide a clear or indisputable answer regarding the competition in which Antony will score his first goal in the 2024-2025 season.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer to the question cannot be validated by the article as it stands because the article discusses past events and does not provide information about future matches or outcomes.\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria that the answer should be sound, clear, and present in or derivable from the article, the question fails to meet the most important criteria.\n\nThe final answer is <answer>0</answer>.", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}
{"title": "The next steps for players out of contract", "description": "New Year\u2019s Day marks the opening of the January transfer market but deals for the summer could take precedence", "maintext": "Real Madrid have made an initial approach to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold for the 2025-26 season now he is free to talk to foreign clubs over a pre-contract, with the Liverpool full-back just one of the stunning names potentially available without a transfer fee come the end of the season.\nThis season, incredibly, four of the biggest names in world football can sign as a free transfer for next July.\nAlexander-Arnold\u2019s team-mates, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, are also in the last six months of their deals. \u201cWe are far away from that,\u201d said Salah when asked about movement on contract talks. Van Dijk has been more positive, saying: \u201cI love the club, the club loves me.\u201d\nYet the noise will not matter to potential suitors for these stellar names. While January 1 is the date they can officially make offers of a pre-contract, due diligence will have been done in the first half of the season, testing whether there is interest in a move and ball-park terms of a contract.\nThere has been silence from Alexander-Arnold on his future, while Liverpool insist they have no wish for him to leave but Spanish newspaper Marca \u2013 known for its close relationship with Real \u2013 is confident the England international will join his close friend Jude Bellingham at the Bernabeu next season. Interestingly, the media outlet has also reported that Van Dijk is not a target, despite the injury to \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o.\nKevin De Bruyne is the other Premier League titan with his future unresolved. \u201cNothing yet,\u201d was the reply at the King Power Stadium when the Manchester City midfielder with 114 assists \u2013 the most among current players \u2013 was asked about his contract progress. De Bruyne, at 33, will still attract clubs in Saudi Arabia looking for a marquee signing, while the USA has also been an option.\nCity could still offer an extension, or a place in their stable of football clubs around the world, such is his standing at the club. It will not have been forgotten how he represented players through Covid in captains meetings rather than Spanish-speaking David Silva, nor his six Premier League titles and Champions League during the treble season.\nAre Bosman deals attractive?\nIt is coming up to 30 years since Jean-Marc Bosman sued the Belgian FA and Uefa for restraint of trade and the \u201cBosman Ruling\u201d came in. It allowed out-of-contract players to move clubs on a free transfer. At the time, the perception was power shifting to the players \u2013 they could run their contracts down and demand increased salaries as their next club would not be paying a transfer fee.\nThe current reality is that Bosmans are lucrative moves for the very best players in the world. With Real Madrid not paying a fee for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the summer when his deal at Paris St-Germain expired, they could pay a signing-on fee to the player \u2013 and a hefty one at \u00a3128 million \u2013 on top of salary and a percentage of image rights.\nBut below the level of Mbapp\u00e9 or Lionel Messi when his contract expired at Barcelona, it is a tough market particularly for older players. Intermediaries working in the Premier League are finding clubs less willing to invest huge free-agent contracts on players when they get to their mid-to-late 20s. The sweet-spot is early 20s for resale value, but lucrative contracts are not being dished out readily.\nJust look at last season. Anthony Martial, still a big name after nine seasons at Manchester United, ended up at AEK Athens in Greece. Adrien Rabiot was touted to all the major European clubs and eventually \u2013 in mid-September \u2013 agreed a deal with Marseille, whose aim this season is getting back into Europe. Mats Hummels has started six games at Roma, while Memphis Depay left Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and moved to Brazil to play for Corinthians.\nCan extensions be thrashed out?\nThe future of Salah, Van Dijk and De Bruyne could still be sorted out before their contracts expire, even with the congested fixture schedule for Premier League clubs. But it has certainly not been a season where clubs have looked to invest in tying down their players to new deals.\nSince the season has started, none of the major names in the Premier League renewed their terms. Morgan Rogers at Aston Villa got a new deal as his form improved and he pushed for an England place, but that has been just about it. Bruno Fernandes and Cole Palmer got their extensions done before the season started.\nCompare that to last season when Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker, Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, Martin Odegaard, Ollie Watkins and Evan Ferguson were just a few to get new deals during the season.\nSome of this is profit and sustainability (PSR) related. So do not be surprised if clubs do agree extensions for players but agree to back-date the salary and pay a lump sum in the summer. It means the figures will go on next season\u2019s books and result in a PSR win.\nWhy not buy now?\nPlayers with expiring contracts will have their value decreasing as they get closer to being a free agent. But generally speaking, interested clubs would rather wait until they are free transfers than pay a fee \u2013 which would still be a significant outlay \u2013 to get them six months earlier.\nUnited moving for Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez is a cautionary tale. The price for the Chile forward rose as Manchester City were also interested so he ended up in a swap deal to Old Trafford worth \u00a335 million, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan going in the other direction. S\u00e1nchez was loaned out the following year and eventually left on a free transfer.\nBest of the rest\nThere are some good deals for clubs looking at Bosmans, although not without risk. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was a hot property at Euro 2020, a back-up to Harry Kane and scoring goals at Everton. He has been hit by injury since and it needs a club to take a chance on him staying fit. Callum Wilson is in a similar position at Newcastle.\nTyrick Mitchell at Crystal Palace, overlooked by England despite their left-back troubles, looks a good prospect for those needing a full-back. Thomas Partey has started 21 games for Arsenal this season and would do a good job for another club. Out of foreign Bosmans, Jonathan Tah, an \u2018Invincible\u2019 with Bayer Leverkusen, will have offers. As will Lille striker Jonathan David. Alphonso Davies at Bayern Munich will join a major club if he moves.\nAngel Gomes broke into the England squad this season and has Premier League clubs looking to take him from Lille. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich\u2019s Leroy San\u00e9 has been linked with a return to England following his spell at Manchester City (2016-20).\nOne-year options\nThere are also a clutch of players with their contracts expiring but their clubs hold options to extend their deals by a year, eliminating the risk of losing them as a free agent. Tottenham captain Son Heung-min is, in theory, out of contract in the summer but his club will trigger his extension until 2026.\nAmad Diallo, one of the only shining lights in Ruben Amorim\u2019s reign at Manchester United, has his contract situation on the agenda at Old Trafford, with the club holding an option on his deal.

This is acceptable.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article mentions that Real Madrid has made an initial approach to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold and cites a Spanish newspaper (Marca) that is confident he will join Real Madrid. However, it does not constitute an official announcement. The article speculates on potential future transfers based on current situations and does not provide a definitive answer to the question as per the resolution criteria.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Real Madrid\" is short (2 words), concrete, and well-defined. It meets this criterion.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a club name. This meets the criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question implies there should be a single correct answer based on an official announcement. The article, however, speculates and does not provide an official confirmation. The resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on an official announcement, which the article does not fulfill.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article does not provide an official confirmation of Trent Alexander-Arnold joining Real Madrid; it only reports on speculation and initial approaches.\n   - The **Definite Resolution by the Article** criterion is not met because the article does not contain an official announcement or confirmation as required by the resolution criteria.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\nGiven that the article does not provide a definitive or official confirmation of Trent Alexander-Arnold joining Real Madrid for the 2025-26 season, and considering the resolution criteria that require an official announcement, the answer cannot be validated based solely on the article.\n\nTherefore, the response should be: \n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question regarding which country's league Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will play in for the 2025-26 season, we must assess the provided article against the specified criteria.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a future event (the 2025-26 season), so it's not in the past tense. The article discusses potential future moves for several players, including Kevin De Bruyne, indicating that it is relevant to the question's timeframe.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that Kevin De Bruyne's future is unresolved and notes that he could attract interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. However, it does not definitively state that he will play in Saudi Arabia for the 2025-26 season. It also mentions that Manchester City could offer him an extension or a place in their global network of clubs. The article does not provide a clear, indisputable answer regarding De Bruyne's destination for the 2025-26 season.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The provided answer is \"Saudi Arabia,\" which is a country and thus fits the requirement of being a short, concrete answer (less than 3 words is not strictly necessary, but \"Saudi Arabia\" is specific).\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"Saudi Arabia\" is not numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies there should be a single correct answer regarding the country whose league Kevin De Bruyne will play in. However, the article suggests multiple possibilities (e.g., staying with Manchester City, potentially moving to Saudi Arabia) without confirming any one outcome.\n\nGiven these criteria:\n\n- The article does not provide a definitive answer regarding Kevin De Bruyne's future for the 2025-26 season; it merely speculates on possibilities.\n- The resolution criteria specified in the question require an \"official announcement from a professional football club or a reliable, major sports news agency,\" which the article is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is not definitively resolved by the article. The article does not confirm that Kevin De Bruyne will play in Saudi Arabia for the 2025-26 season; it only mentions Saudi Arabia as one of the potential destinations.\n\nSince the article does not provide a definitive and indisputable answer to the question, the most critical criterion (**Definite resolution of the answer by the article**) is not met.\n\nThe final assessment is: <answer>0</answer>.", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To determine whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's analyze the question and the given criteria step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about whether Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min's contract will be extended into the 2025-26 season.

The start date is December 10, 2024, and the resolution date is July 1, 2025. The time horizon is more than a single day, and the question is forward-looking. Thus, it is valid for forecasting.\n\n2. **Tense**: The question is not stated in the past tense; it's about a future event (contract extension). So, it passes this criterion.\n\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question can be resolved with either \"Yes\" or \"No,\" and it is designed such that only one of these answers can be correct. Thus, it has a single correct answer.\n\n4. **Impact**: The outcome of this question is relevant to Tottenham Hotspur fans, the football community, and potentially the sports news industry. It has a significant following and interest, so it has a considerable impact.\n\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is binary as it requires a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. This fails the criterion that the question should not be binary or multiple choice.\n\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable. It provides sufficient details about the context (Son Heung-min's contract status) and the resolution criteria (official statement from Tottenham Hotspur or a reliable sports news agency).\n\n7. **Definite Answer**: The provided answer is \"Yes,\" which is definite. However, the question's binary nature and the answer format (\"Yes\" or \"No\") mean it doesn't meet the criterion of not being binary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe given question fails to meet two of the criteria: it is binary (\"Yes\" or \"No\" answer), and its answer type is not free-form or numerical. Despite having a significant impact and being understandable and forward-looking, it doesn't satisfy all the given criteria.\n\nGiven there's only one question to analyze and it doesn't meet all the criteria due to being binary, the response should reflect that no suitable question was found based on the provided criteria.\n\n**Output:**\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>NO GOOD QUESTION FOUND</question_title>\n<background></background>\n<resolution_criteria></resolution_criteria>\n<answer></answer>\n<answer_type></answer_type>\n</q1>", "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}
{"title": "How much will Labour cost you?", "description": "Telegraph Money analysis reveals the impact of Starmer's tax raid", "maintext": "From January 1st, private schools pay VAT for the first time.\nOne in five schools are passing on the full 20pc increase in higher fees to parents, Telegraph Money analysis reveals. The majority are not (for now, at least).\nOn average, Britain\u2019s private schools are raising fees by 13.7pc between the first and second school terms, when the policy takes effect.\nOur league table analyses the fees of over 1,200 fee-paying schools across Britain to see how those local to you have adapted to Labour\u2019s tax raid and, crucially, how this affects value for money through exam results.\nIndependent schools come in all shapes and sizes, with fees ranging from less than \u00a310,000 a year to in excess of \u00a360,000 for boarders at the most expensive institutions.\nHowever, one thing clear is that Labour\u2019s tax raid has vastly reduced the options for parents of more modest means.\nIn 2022-23, around 57pc of day fees were less than \u00a320,000 a year. Had fees increased with inflation, this figure would be 47pc today.\nHowever, the VAT hike, confirmed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Budget, means that today just 25pc of schools are below that threshold.\nWith fees costing more, parents will rightly be conscious about whether a school produces results worthy of the extra investment \u2013 and just because a school is expensive, it doesn\u2019t guarantee results.\nLast year, Cardiff Sixth Form College recorded the best results among fee-paying schools with over 95pc of exams being graded the top grades of A* or A at A-Level. However, with VAT forcing fees up to \u00a330,000 a year for its day pupils, the school will be out of reach for many.\nTelegraph Money analysis shows that, once you compare the top results relative to fees, lesser-known schools produce similarly impressive results \u2013 but at a fraction of the cost.\nAt the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students is The Cathedral School in Wales, where fees are \u00a315,000 a year cheaper, but around 87pc of pupils are given the top grades at A-Levels and 64pc in GCSEs.\nWithington Girls\u2019 School in Manchester has around 90pc of GCSEs and 74pc of A-levels at A* or A, based on exams taken in 2023. But its fees are among the lowest in the country, at \u00a317,892 a year, even after the VAT change.\nHowever, for many parents the value of independent schools goes beyond academic achievements.\nWhile stalwarts of the public school system, such as Eton, Winchester, Tonbridge and Radley, produce excellent results, albeit at a steep price, they argue their higher fees contribute to multi-million pound capital projects and extracurricular activities.\nA spokesman from the Independent Schools Council said: \u201cIndependent schools take a much wider view of education than just exam results. Boarding schools in particular offer a wide range of activities outside the classroom and subjects inside the classroom.\u201d\nEton, for example, with fees of \u00a352,749 a year, recently opened a \u00a320m sports facility complete with an indoor pool, climbing wall, squash courts and fencing salle.\nOur league table also allows parents to find the fees most relevant to their child\u2019s current age \u2013 a first for a private school league table.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/private-school-labour-tax-raid-best-value/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 07:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:39+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the average percentage fee increase for Britain's private schools between the first and second school terms of the 2024-25 academic year, when the new VAT policy takes effect?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The question is stated in future tense, which is acceptable. The article is discussing a change that takes effect from January 1st, implying it's about the 2024-25 academic year since it mentions the impact of VAT introduction on fees. So, the tense is appropriate.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article states, \"On average, Britain\u2019s private schools are raising fees by 13.7pc between the first and second school terms, when the policy takes effect.\" This directly answers the question about the average percentage fee increase. Thus, the answer can be derived from the article and is clearly stated.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer given is \"13.7%\". It is short, specific, and well-defined, adhering to the requirement of not being more than 3 words.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is a percentage, which is numeric. Hence, it fails this criterion because the task specifies that the answer type should not be numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific percentage that represents the average increase across all reported schools. The article provides a clear average increase of 13.7%, making it the sole correct answer based on the information given.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The question is appropriately framed in terms of tense.\n- The answer is clearly resolved by the article.\n- The answer is well-defined but is numeric (percentage), which fails one of the criteria.\n- The answer is the single correct one based on the article.\n\nSince one of the criteria (Non-Numeric) is not met because the answer is a percentage, the validation fails.\n\nThe final output should be:\n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer based on the provided article, let's analyze the question step by step and check it against the given criteria.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about determining which independent school in Wales will have the best fee-to-grade ratio for A-Level students following the implementation of VAT on private school fees. The question is stated in a future tense (\"will have\"), which is acceptable. However, the specific details about the future implementation and ranking are mentioned, which requires checking if the article provides a definitive answer.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that \"At the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students is The Cathedral School in Wales, where fees are \u00a315,000 a year cheaper, but around 87pc of pupils are given the top grades at A-Levels and 64pc in GCSEs.\" This indicates that The Cathedral School is currently at the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students according to the analysis provided. The article serves as a source of truth for the current ranking and implies that this is relevant after the VAT implementation, as it discusses the impact of VAT on fees.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"The Cathedral School.\" It is a specific name and not more than three words, adhering to the well-defined criteria.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is \"string (name),\" which is not numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks the name of a specific school. The article supports \"The Cathedral School\" as the answer by stating it is at the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students. The article does not suggest there are multiple schools with the same top ranking, implying a single correct answer.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is about a future state (\"will have\") but is grounded in current analysis.\n- The article provides a clear ranking that includes The Cathedral School as having the best fee-to-grade ratio.\n- The answer is well-defined, non-numeric, and appears to be the sole correct answer based on the information given.\n\nHowever, the question's resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on a published league table or analysis after the new term's fees are in effect, which is expected by the end of January 2025. The article, while relevant and providing current analysis, does not explicitly state the future ranking after the VAT implementation takes effect. It implies The Cathedral School is top based on current data.\n\nSince the article provides relevant information that supports \"The Cathedral School\" as the top school in terms of fee-grade ratio for A-Level students and there's no indication of multiple correct answers or ambiguity in the answer, we can consider it valid based on the content.\n\nThus, considering all the criteria and the fact that the article directly supports the answer, the response should be:\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer based on the provided article, let's go through each segment and the specified criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question asks for the annual day fee for Cardiff Sixth Form College for the term starting after January 1st, 2025.\n   - **Background:** It provides context about Cardiff Sixth Form College and mentions a new tax policy affecting private schools, leading to a fee increase.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** Specifies that the answer should be based on the official fee schedule or a major news outlet's report, resolved by January 15th, 2025, and formatted as a monetary value in British pounds.\n   - **Answer:** \u00a330,000.\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a future event (term starting after January 1st, 2025), so it's not in the past tense. This is acceptable.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article mentions that \"with VAT forcing fees up to \u00a330,000 a year for its day pupils\" for Cardiff Sixth Form College. This directly answers the question regarding the fee for Cardiff Sixth Form College after the VAT change takes effect. Thus, the article does resolve the answer definitely.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"\u00a330,000\" is short, concrete, and well-defined, although it is more than 3 words when including the currency symbol and comma. However, it's a specific monetary value.\n   - **Non-Numeric (though the answer is numeric, the format is monetary):** The answer is a monetary value, \"\u00a330,000\", which is acceptable as it is not just a numeric value but formatted as currency.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question is specific about the school and the term, suggesting a single correct answer. The article directly supports the answer \u00a330,000.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly mentions that Cardiff Sixth Form College's day pupil fees will be \"up to \u00a330,000 a year\" after VAT is applied. This supports the answer \u00a330,000.\n   - Although the answer is a monetary value and not just a simple word, it is specific and directly derived from the article.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's assess the criteria:\n- The question is not about a past event, so tense is not an issue.\n- The article does provide a clear basis for the answer.\n- The answer is well-defined and specific.\n- The format is monetary, which is acceptable given the context.\n- The question implies a single correct answer, and the article supports it.\n\nThus, the validation checks out for the most part. The answer is derived from the article and is specific. However, it's worth noting that the \"Well-defined Answer\" criteria might be considered somewhat lenient here due to the length and format of \"\u00a330,000\". Nonetheless, it is a clear, specific monetary value.\n\nThe final step is to determine if all criteria are met:\n1. Tense: OK (not past tense).\n2. Definite resolution: OK (resolved by the article).\n3. Well-defined: OK (though a bit lenient due to the length, it's a specific monetary value).\n4. Non-Numeric: The answer is a monetary value, which is acceptable.\n5. Single Correct Answer: OK (the question implies a single answer, and the article supports it).\n\nTherefore, considering the provided article directly supports the answer and meets the specified criteria upon a lenient interpretation regarding the \"Well-defined Answer\" length, the response should be:\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question from the provided list, we need to analyze each question based on the given criteria.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about predicting which independent school in Wales will have the best fee-to-grade ratio for A-Level students after the implementation of VAT on private school fees. The time horizon is from December 15th, 2024, to the end of January 2025, which is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking and not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a single correct answer, which is the name of the school with the best fee-to-grade ratio.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome will be relevant to parents and students considering independent schools in Wales, potentially affecting a significant number of people.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is not binary or multiple-choice; it requires the name of a school.\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient details about the context and the criteria for resolution.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer provided is \"The Cathedral School,\" which is a specific and definite name.\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about predicting the annual day fee for Cardiff Sixth Form College for the term starting after January 1st, 2025. The time horizon is from December 15th, 2024, to January 15th, 2025, which is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking and not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a single correct answer, which is the monetary value of the fee.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome will be relevant to parents and students considering Cardiff Sixth Form College, potentially affecting a significant number of people.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is not binary or multiple-choice; it requires a monetary value.\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient details about the context and the criteria for resolution.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer provided is \"\u00a330,000,\" which is a specific and definite monetary value.\n\n### Comparison\n\nBoth questions meet the criteria for being valid for forecasting, not being in the past tense, having a single correct answer, being understandable, and having a definite answer. They are also not binary or multiple-choice.\n\n- **Impact**: Both questions have a significant impact, but Question 1 has a broader relevance as it compares multiple schools, potentially affecting a larger number of people considering various independent schools in Wales.\n- **Specificity and Clarity**: Both questions are clear and specific.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth questions are well-structured and meet the given criteria. However, Question 1 has a potentially broader impact as it relates to multiple schools and a comparative analysis, which could be of interest to a wider audience. \n\nTherefore, the best question is:\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>Which independent school in Wales will have the best fee-to-grade ratio for A-Level students following the implementation of VAT on private school fees?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The opposite is true outside London, where parents often have little choice in where to educate their children, and even less now fees will rise by roughly \u00a32,000 a year.\nFew people would argue against spending more on state education, but the model the Government has chosen really is nonsensical, driven as it is by ideology, not economics, and the perverse effects of a manifesto promise not to raise income tax.\nIn a desperate bid to tease voters away from the Conservatives, Labour promised not to increase income tax \u2013 by far the biggest revenue raiser for the Treasury.\nIf it really wants to raise money from those with the \u201cbroadest shoulders\u201d it would be far more logical to, for instance, introduce another tax band for the very highest earners. But of course that is now impossible without breaking a manifesto pledge.\nTaxing private school parents to fund state schools (which they are already funding through normal taxation) is completely bone-headed.\nYou could even argue that parents should be given tax breaks, perhaps by allowing school fees to be part of \u201csalary sacrifice\u201d schemes, given they are freeing up state-funded places. There is a similar argument to be made for people using private healthcare and alleviating strain on the NHS.\nTo rub further salt into the wound the Government claims that the VAT raid is \u201cending a tax break\u201d for private schools. That\u2019s clearly disingenuous given they don\u2019t receive a penny of public money (unlike in countries including Denmark and Australia).\nWhat comes next? The logical Labour move is for a renewed attack on our 150-odd remaining grammar schools, perhaps the biggest engines of social mobility this country has ever produced.\nThat would truly be a disastrous move but, with this mob, there is no reason to think logic will stop them.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/welcome-to-2025-where-taxing-education-is-seen-as-moral/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:45+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the next type of school targeted by Labour's education policy after taxing private schools, by the end of 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 1st December 2024.

The question is stated in the future tense, which is acceptable. The timeframe mentioned (by the end of 2025) is also relevant to the task.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article discusses Labour's policy of taxing private schools and mentions that \"What comes next? The logical Labour move is for a renewed attack on our 150-odd remaining grammar schools...\" This indicates that according to the article, the next target could be \"grammar schools.\" The article provides a clear direction regarding the potential next step in Labour's education policy.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"grammar schools.\" It is short (2 words), concrete, specific, and well-defined. It fits the accepted answer format as stated in the resolution criteria.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"grammar schools\" is not numeric; it is a type of school. Thus, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question asks for the \"next type of school targeted\" based on the article's content. The article suggests that \"grammar schools\" are likely to be the next target. While it is written in a speculative manner (\"The logical Labour move is...\"), it presents \"grammar schools\" as the probable next target, implying it is the correct answer based on the information given in the article. However, the phrasing \"logical Labour move\" introduces a level of interpretation. Still, within the context of the article, \"grammar schools\" is presented as the most likely next target, making it the sole correct answer based on the article's content.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is in an acceptable tense.\n- The article provides a clear indication of the next target.\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- The answer is presented as the sole likely outcome in the article.\n\nTherefore, the validation checks are largely positive. However, it's crucial to note that the article does not state this as a fact but rather as a logical deduction (\"The logical Labour move...\"). Despite this, based on the information provided in the article, \"grammar schools\" is the answer derived from the content.\n\nThus, considering all the criteria and the context provided, the response should be based on whether the answer is validated by the article.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer based on the given article, let's go through each segment and criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question title asks which group will experience increased education costs due to the new VAT policy on private schools by mid-2025.\n   - **Background:** The background mentions a new VAT policy affecting private schools and concerns about rising costs for certain demographics.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on reliable reports, and it should be the name of the group facing higher education costs as a direct result of the VAT policy.\n   - **Answer:** The provided answer is \"private school parents.\"\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in future tense (\"will experience\"), which is acceptable. The article discusses the impact of taxing private school parents, which is related to the question.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article discusses the VAT raid on private schools and its implications, indicating that private school parents will be affected by increased fees. The article states, \"Taxing private school parents to fund state schools... is completely bone-headed.\" This directly relates to the question and implies that private school parents will face increased costs.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"private school parents\" is short (three words), concrete, and specific. It directly corresponds to the group discussed in the article as being affected by the VAT policy.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a group name, so it satisfies this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The article focuses on the impact of the VAT policy on private school parents, suggesting that they are the primary group affected by the increased education costs. While one could argue about the interpretation, the context strongly suggests that \"private school parents\" is the intended group. The article does not clearly present multiple groups as having distinct, equally valid outcomes regarding increased education costs due to the VAT policy. Thus, \"private school parents\" can be considered the sole correct answer based on the article.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Answer:**\n   - The article supports the notion that \"private school parents\" will face increased education costs due to the VAT policy on private schools.\n   - The answer is well-defined and directly derived from the context provided by the article.\n   - The question's resolution criteria are met as the article serves as a reliable report confirming the group facing higher education costs.\n\nGiven the analysis, the question and its answer align with the criteria specified:\n- The question is appropriately framed.\n- The answer is supported by the article.\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- The answer is the sole correct one based on the article's content.\n\nTherefore, the response should be positive.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question, let's break down the question and check it against the given criteria.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about the Labour government's tax policy in 2025 based on its manifesto promise. It is stated in a future context (\"will not increase\") which is acceptable.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions, \"Labour promised not to increase income tax \u2013 by far the biggest revenue raiser for the Treasury.\" This directly supports the answer that the tax Labour will not increase is \"income tax\". Thus, the answer is sound and clear from the article.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"income tax\", which is short (2 words), concrete, specific, and well-defined. It is not more than 3 words.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"income tax\" is not numeric; it is a string representing the name of a tax. So, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question is about a specific tax that Labour promised not to increase. The article clearly states that it is \"income tax\". There is no indication that there are multiple correct answers to this question. Thus, it satisfies the criterion of having a single correct answer.\n\nGiven the above analysis, let's verify if all criteria are met:\n- The question is not in past tense and is specific.\n- The answer is clearly resolved by the article.\n- The answer is well-defined and not more than 3 words.\n- The answer is not numeric.\n- There is a single correct answer.\n\nAll the criteria are met.

It is forward-looking with a time horizon from 1st December 2024 to 31st December 2025, which is more than a single day. Thus, it is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not stated in the past tense; it is about a future event. So, it passes this criterion.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific type of school, implying a single correct answer based on the official announcement. Thus, it potentially has a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome will be relevant to those interested in education policy, potentially affecting many people, especially parents and students. It has a significant impact.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a free-form string answer (the name of a school type), not a binary or multiple-choice response. So, it passes this criterion.\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient context about Labour's education policy and the recent VAT charge on private schools, making it understandable.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"grammar schools\" is definite and well-defined, not vague or a range.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: This question is about which group will experience increased education costs due to the new VAT policy by mid-2025. It is forward-looking from 1st December 2024 to 30th June 2025, making it valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense. So, it passes this criterion.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies there is a specific group that will be identified, suggesting a single correct answer. \n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to those affected by the VAT policy, potentially a significant number of people. It has a considerable impact.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The answer is a free-form string (the name of a group), so it is not binary or multiple-choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear about the context and the VAT policy's impact.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"private school parents\" is definite.\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question concerns which tax the Labour government will not increase in 2025. It is forward-looking from 1st December 2024 to 31st December 2025, so it is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single tax will not be increased, suggesting a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to taxpayers and those interested in tax policy, potentially a large number of people. It has a significant impact.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The answer is a free-form string (the name of a tax), so it is not binary or multiple-choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear about its context regarding Labour's manifesto promise.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"income tax\" is definite.\n\n### Comparison\nAll three questions meet the criteria:\n- They are valid for forecasting.\n- Not stated in the past tense.\n- Imply a single correct answer.\n- Have significant impact.\n- Are not binary or multiple-choice.\n- Are understandable.\n- Have definite answers.\n\nTo choose the best question, we need to consider the **Impact** criterion more deeply. All questions relate to significant policy changes by the Labour government, potentially affecting a large number of people. However, the impact of Question 0 (\"What will be the next type of school targeted by Labour's education policy...\") and Question 2 (\"Which tax will the Labour government not increase in 2025...\") could be considered broad due to their implications on education policy and tax policy, respectively. Question 1 is more specific to the consequences of a particular policy (VAT on private schools) and might be seen as having a significant but somewhat more focused impact.\n\nGiven the information and the criteria, **Question 2** appears to have a potentially broader impact as it deals with tax policy, which can affect virtually the entire population, not just those directly involved with private schooling.\n\n### Output\n<q1>\n<question_id>2</question_id>\n<question_title>Which tax will the Labour government not increase in 2025, based on its manifesto promise?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 1st December 2024.

It has a Lowlander route between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a Highlander route to Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William.\nThe complaint tally was disclosed as fares on the service were increased by an inflation-busting 6.39 per cent on New Year\u2019s Day.\nSue Webber, the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 transport spokesman, said the figures suggested that the SNP\u2019s nationalisation was \u201cnot going to plan\u201d and \u201cpassengers were receiving a subpar service.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cJust like SNP-run ScotRail, it looks like they have messed up the nationalisation of the Caledonian Sleeper as well. Passengers are receiving a sub-par service and as a result complaints have continued to pour in from them.\n\u201cTaxpayers have also had to foot the bill for nearly a million pounds in compensation payments, largely for delayed services. If the SNP want to get people out of their cars and onto public transport, then they must change their current approach.\u201d\nThe figures disclosed that 519 complaints were made between June 25 2023 and March 31 2024. A further 364 were lodged between April 1 2024 and Sept 14 this year. Of the total, 286 were made about the upkeep and repair of the train.\nBut Transport Scotland said: \u201cThe latest ORR passenger satisfaction results show that almost 90 per cent of Caledonian Sleeper guests were satisfied with their overall experience, with complaints (934) representing just 0.2 per cent of the almost 400,000 journeys made since the Caledonian Sleeper came into public sector control.\n\u201cIndeed, the latest ORR figures also show that complaints were down by 39 per cent in the 12-month reporting period (April 2023 to March 2024) in comparison to the 12 months prior \u2013 demonstrating a significant downward trend during public sector ownership.\u201d\nIt said that fewer than 3 per cent of services had been cancelled in the year to September and \u201cit is only right that passengers are compensated when disruption does occur\u201d.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/caledonian-sleeper-1000-complaints-since-snp-took-over/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 07:15:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:52+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>When will the Caledonian Sleeper next increase its fares?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The question is being asked starting from 15th December 2024.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on an official public announcement from the Caledonian Sleeper operator or Transport Scotland regarding the date of a fare increase. The answer should be in the format of the month and year when the fare increase is scheduled to begin.\n   - **Answer:** January 2025\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a future event (next fare increase), so it's not in the past tense. It's appropriately framed for a future occurrence.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article mentions that fares were increased by 6.39% on New Year's Day. There's no information about the next fare increase after that. Thus, the article does not provide a clear answer to when the Caledonian Sleeper will next increase its fares after the mentioned increase.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"January 2025\" is concise and specific, adhering to the required format (month and year).\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is a string representing a date, not numeric.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question implies a singular next fare increase, so it inherently suggests a single correct answer.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article states that fares were increased on New Year's Day, which implies January 1st of a given year. Since the article doesn't specify the year of this increase but mentions it happened recently and that the complaint tally was disclosed as fares were increased, we can infer it refers to January 1, 2024, or January 1, 2025. Given the context that the question start date is December 15, 2024, and there's a mention of a recent fare increase, it's plausible that the increase referred to is January 1, 2025.\n   - However, the article doesn't explicitly state that the next fare increase after the question's start date (December 15, 2024) will be in January 2025. It only mentions a past increase on New Year's Day without clearly stating the year of this event in the provided text.\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   - The article doesn't provide a clear, direct statement about future fare increases beyond mentioning a recent increase on New Year's Day. Without a clear indication that this refers to January 2025 or any confirmation of a future increase, the answer cannot be definitively validated by the article.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The article does not provide a definitive answer to the question of when the Caledonian Sleeper will next increase its fares. The information given is about a past event (fare increase on New Year's Day) without specifying it's about 2025. Thus, the answer \"January 2025\" cannot be confirmed based on the article.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the answer to the question cannot be validated based on the information provided in the article. Therefore, the response should be:\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer based on the provided article, let's analyze each component step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about the total taxpayer-funded compensation paid to Caledonian Sleeper passengers since nationalisation by the end of 2024. It is stated in the future tense (\"will reach by the end of 2024\"), which is acceptable according to the criteria.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that nearly \u00a31 million of taxpayer-funded compensation payments had been paid out to disappointed passengers since the service was taken into public ownership. However, it does not provide a definitive figure for the total compensation by the end of 2024. The article's data is not future-looking to the end of 2024; it provides information up to a certain point after nationalisation but before December 2024. Thus, the article does not resolve the answer definitely for the end of 2024.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"\u00a31 million,\" which is specific and well-defined. It is also not more than 3 words when considering the monetary format.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is a monetary amount (\"\u00a31 million\"), which, while numeric in nature, is presented in a specific format. However, the criteria specify that the answer type should not be numeric. The answer is on the edge but is considered as a string (monetary amount) as per the question's answer type.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific monetary total. However, the article does not provide a definitive figure for the end of 2024, making \"\u00a31 million\" potentially not the sole correct answer for the end of 2024, as the actual figure could change.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The question is in an acceptable tense.\n- The article does not provide a definitive answer for the compensation by the end of 2024.\n- The answer is well-defined.\n- The answer type is considered acceptable as a string (monetary amount).\n- The question's answer may not be the sole correct answer due to the lack of specific information in the article for the end of 2024.\n\nThe most critical issue here is that the article does not provide a definitive resolution for the question regarding the total taxpayer-funded compensation by the end of 2024. The information given is up to a certain point before December 2024, and it does not guarantee that \"\u00a31 million\" will be the total by the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria that the answer should be definitely resolved by the article, the validation fails because the article does not provide the required future data.\n\nThe final output should be:\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's go through the given criteria one by one.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about the overall trend in passenger complaints for the Caledonian Sleeper for the reporting period April 2024 to March 2025. The question is stated in the future tense relative to the article's publication date (since the article does not provide a specific date but mentions \"this year\" in relation to Sept 14, implying the article is from 2024). The period in question (April 2024 to March 2025) is in the future relative to the data provided in the article (up to Sept 14, 2024). Thus, the question is not about a past event described in the article but rather about a future period. This does not directly fail the criteria since it's acceptable for the question to be in the current or future tense.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article discusses complaints up to September 14, 2024, and provides data for the periods before and after April 1, 2024. However, it does not provide the total number of complaints for the period from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. The article mentions a 39% decrease in complaints in the 12-month reporting period (April 2023 to March 2024) compared to the previous 12 months. It does not directly state the trend for April 2024 to March 2025. Thus, the article does not directly resolve the answer for the specified future period.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"downward trend,\" which is short and specific, fitting the required format of a short, specific phrase describing the overall change in complaint volume.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is a string describing a trend, not numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a description of the trend, which could be one of several possibilities (downward, upward, or stable). The provided answer is \"downward trend.\" The article does not provide definitive information about the period in question (April 2024 to March 2025), so we cannot confirm if this is the sole correct answer based on the article.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is about a future period relative to the data available in the article.\n- The article does not provide the necessary data to definitively answer the question for the period April 2024 to March 2025.\n- The answer \"downward trend\" is based on data from a previous period (April 2023 to March 2024) but is not directly supported for the period in question.\n\nTherefore, the article does not provide a definite resolution to the question regarding the trend for the specified future period (April 2024 to March 2025).\n\nThe final assessment is that the criteria for a valid answer are not met because the article does not provide the necessary information to definitively resolve the question for the period in question.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}
{"title": "Dry January a 'fashionable excuse for dangerous drinking in December'", "description": "Alcohol continues to kill at record levels and remains Britain\u2019s primary addiction", "maintext": "Dry January has become a fashionable excuse to justify dangerous drinking habits in December and February, addiction experts have warned.\nIt is estimated that almost one in three men and around one-quarter of women are planning to avoid alcohol in the new year, according to the charity Alcohol Change UK, which founded Dry January in 2013.\nBut the Priory Group, one of the UK\u2019s leading alcohol withdrawal specialists, has issued an urgent warning, arguing that the scheme could exacerbate Britain\u2019s harmful drinking culture.\nDr Niall Campbell, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory Group, said: \u201cDry January is a fantastic initiative. It is very popular and the health benefits of completing it are significant.\n\u201cBut I worry that it has become a fashionable exercise for a lot of people. As a society, we need a wake-up call.\n\u201cIf you use Dry January as an excuse to drink to excess in December and February, and the rest of the year, then you\u2019re missing the point. Increasingly, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\nThe foundations of Dry January began in 2011 when Emily Robinson signed up for a half marathon in February and vowed to give up alcohol for the month before in preparation. She found she lost weight, slept better and gained more energy.\nWhen Ms Robinson joined Alcohol Change UK the following year, she suggested making Dry January an annual challenge to show people how much their health improved with a month off booze.\nAround 15.5 million people in the UK are expected to abstain from alcohol for 31 days, starting on Wednesday.\nHowever, new figures from Alcohol Change UK show that 26 per cent of men who drink said they had increased their intake in 2024 compared with 2023, while over a third (35 per cent) reported drinking above the low-risk guidelines of 14 units per week.\n\u2018Men heavily targeted to drink more\u2019\nDr Richard Piper, CEO at Alcohol Change UK, which is targeting male drinking this year, said: \u201cMen are heavily targeted by the alcohol industry to get us to drink more and more alcohol.\n\u201cThese companies spend millions putting booze front and centre of the things we love, from sporting events, gigs and \u2018lads nights out\u2019 to products in our favourite TV shows and films, or just via inescapable advertising we see as we go about our lives and on social media.\n\u201cYet, our research tells us that the tide is turning. With nearly one in three men planning a break from booze this January, it\u2019s clear they are making the link between what they drink and how it could be holding them back physically, mentally and in their day-to-day life.\u201d\nThe Priory Group warned that despite the good intentions, alcohol continued to kill at record levels, with more than 8,200 deaths in 2023 \u2013 a 42 per cent rise on 2019. It remains Britain\u2019s primary addiction, with 59 per cent of people seeking help at the Priory doing so for alcohol misuse.\n\u201cThe evidence shows that younger generations are reducing their alcohol intake, which is fantastic,\u201d added Dr Campbell.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m extremely worried about slightly older generations who grew up with harmful drinking habits and are drinking more than ever.\n\u201cI\u2019d implore everyone to embrace January as a time to reflect on their drinking habits, learn how to enjoy social events or to relax at home without alcohol, and carry those lessons learnt through the rest of the year. Alcohol is harmful and addictive, and sadly I see its consequences every day.\u201d\nExperts warn that recorded alcohol deaths were \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d because they did not include other drinking-related causes, such as intoxication resulting in fatal accidents, withdrawal seizures, heart attacks and strokes.\nAlcohol Change UK said it was important that people used their official Dry January tools, which include tracking and daily email coaching. Research has shown that people embarking on the challenge on their own are only half as likely to succeed.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/dry-january-dangerous-drinking-december-alcohol-addiction/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 06:11:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:28:58+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>On which day of the week will Dry January 2025 begin?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: December 15, 2024.

The answer should be the day of the week.\n   - **Answer:** Wednesday\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in future tense, which is acceptable. However, it asks about Dry January 2025, while the article discusses Dry January starting on a Wednesday without specifying the year as 2025. The article implies the current year or a specific year context (2024 is mentioned in the article). The question is not directly answered by the article because it refers to a future event (Dry January 2025) not covered by the article.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article states that \"Around 15.5 million people in the UK are expected to abstain from alcohol for 31 days, starting on Wednesday.\" However, it does not specify the year. The context implies that the article is talking about an upcoming Dry January, likely referring to January 2024 since it mentions \"in 2024 compared with 2023.\" Thus, the article does not directly resolve the question for Dry January 2025.\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Wednesday\" is short, concrete, and well-defined, adhering to the criteria of not being more than 3 words.\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is a string (day of the week), not numeric, so it passes this criterion.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The day of the week for January 1st of any given year is fixed and can be determined. Thus, there is a single correct answer for the day of the week Dry January 2025 will begin on, based on the calendar.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article mentions that Dry January starts on a Wednesday but does not specify the year. It implies a context that is likely about the upcoming January at the time of writing, which appears to be January 2024 based on the comparisons made in the article (e.g., drinking habits in 2024 compared to 2023).\n   - The question asks about Dry January 2025, which is not directly addressed by the article. The start day of the week for January 2025 cannot be derived from the information given in the article.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question fails the **Definite Resolution by the Article** criterion because the article does not provide information about Dry January 2025.

The answer \"men\" is valid for 2024 according to the article but not necessarily for 2025.\n   - The **Definite Resolution by the Article** criterion is not met because the article does not discuss the 2025 campaign.\n\nTherefore, based on the given criteria and analysis, the output should be:\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's analyze the question and the article step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is stated in future tense (\"will be reported\"), which is acceptable.

The resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on reports from major UK health organizations or treatment providers published in early 2025, which the article does not represent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given criteria, especially the one regarding the definite resolution of the answer by the article and the future tense of the question, the validation fails because the article does not provide information about future reports or statistics for 2025.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}

He was the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Britain\u2019s largest terrorist atrocity.\nA total of 270 people were killed when the Boeing 747 Clipper Maid of the Seas broke apart at 31,000ft as it flew from Heathrow to New York on Dec 21 1988.\nThe total included 11 people in the Dumfries and Galloway town of Lockerbie when the plane fell on their homes.\nBut the papers disclosed that no formal discussion about the controversial decision to free him was held by the Scottish Cabinet, which included Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon, the deputy first minister at the time.\nOnly sparse mentions of Megrahi are made in the minutes, including an acknowledgement by Kenny MacAskill, then the justice secretary, of an application by the Libyan government under Muammar Gaddafi for Megrahi\u2019s release.\nMegrahi was released on Aug 20 that year, hours after the announcement, and flown back to the Libyan capital Tripoli, where he received a hero\u2019s welcome from a crowd waving Scottish flags.\nThe scenes enraged people on both sides of the Atlantic, and the decision was condemned by Barack Obama and David Cameron, respectively the US president and UK prime minister at the time.\nScottish Cabinet papers from June that year reported: \u201cMr MacAskill said that on behalf of Scottish ministers, he was considering the formal application made by the Libyan government on May 5 2009 for the transfer of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi under the terms of the prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libya.\u201d\nIn a further meeting on Aug 18, two days before the public announcement of the decision to release the prisoner, the papers read: \u201cMr MacAskill said that he is expected to be in a position to make a statement in relation to the prisoner transfer application and the application for compassionate release in the near future.\u201d\nBut it took three years for Megrahi to die of the cancer, which it was claimed in 2009 could kill him within months.\nSpeaking recently on the anniversary of the bombing, Mr MacAskill said: \u201cWe do have rules for compassionate release which exist in Scotland.\n\u201cIt is dealt with by medical experts, the report came in that he had a prognosis of three months.

The article mentions that Mas'ud \"will go on trial\" in May, indicating a future event relative to the time the article was written. Thus, the tense is appropriate for the context provided by the article.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article states, \"In May, Abu Agila Mas'ud, another Libyan, will go on trial at a federal court in Washington, accused of making the bomb.\" This directly supports the answer \"May 2025\" because it implies the trial is happening in May of a future year relative to the article's content. However, the article does not explicitly mention the year \"2025.\" It only mentions that Mas'ud \"will go on trial\" in May. The year \"2025\" is inferred based on the context that the article is discussing future events relative to some point in time. The exact year is not directly stated in the article, which could be seen as a lack of direct evidence for \"2025.\"\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"May 2025\" is concise and specific, fitting the required format of \"Month Year.\" However, the article doesn't directly state the year \"2025\"; it just says \"In May.\"\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is a string representing a date (\"Month Year\"), not purely numeric.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question implies a single correct answer based on when the trial begins.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article directly supports that the trial is in May but does not explicitly state the year as \"2025.\" The inference to \"2025\" is not directly supported by the article's content. The article was likely written before 2025, given the context that it discusses future events happening in May, implying May of the following year or a year after the article's publication.\n   - The main issue here is whether the article directly supports \"May 2025.\" The article directly mentions \"In May\" regarding the trial, but the year is not specified.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question's answer relies on the inference that the year is \"2025,\" which is not directly stated in the article. The article does confirm that the trial will be in May, supporting part of the answer.\n   - The criteria that the answer should be directly derivable from the article is not fully met because the year \"2025\" is not explicitly mentioned.\n   - Given the information and focusing strictly on the criteria:\n     - The tense is appropriate.\n     - The definite resolution is partially met; the month is directly supported, but the year is inferred.\n     - The answer format is as required.\n     - The answer type is not numeric.\n     - The question implies a single correct answer.\n\nHowever, the critical issue is that the article does not explicitly state \"2025.\" Thus, while \"May\" is directly supported, \"May 2025\" is not entirely validated by the article due to the lack of explicit mention of the year.\n\nGiven the strict criteria and focusing on the fact that the year \"2025\" is not directly mentioned in the article, the validation of the answer as \"1\" (valid) or \"0\" (invalid) hinges on the interpretation of \"definite resolution of the answer by the article.\"\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question based on the given article, let's break down the task into the required steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is about the broadcast date of the Sky TV series \"Lockerbie: A Search for Truth\". The question title directly asks for this date.\n\n2. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a future event relative to the article's publication. The article does not specify the tense of the broadcast relative to its own publication date, but it mentions the series \"will be broadcast on Thursday\". This indicates a future tense relative to the article.\n\n3. **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article**: The article states that the series \"will be broadcast on Thursday\". However, it does not provide a specific date. The day of the week (Thursday) is given, but without a specific date, this information is incomplete for determining the exact broadcast date.\n\n4. **Well-defined Answer**: The provided answer is \"2 January 2025\", which is a specific date. However, the article does not mention this date. The answer is not derived from the information given in the article.\n\n5. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is a date, which is not considered numeric in the context of being a percentage, integer, decimal, or a range. However, the format and derivation are critical here.\n\n6. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific date. If the article provided a clear date or a way to definitively determine the date, this criterion would be met. However, the article does not provide the date directly or indirectly in a manner that allows for a definitive conclusion.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- The question is about a future event, so tense is not an issue.\n- The article does not provide a clear or definitive answer to the question about the broadcast date.\n- The answer \"2 January 2025\" is not present in or derivable from the article.\n- The answer is a date, which is specific but not derived from the article.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is not valid based on the article because it does not contain the information required to answer the question definitively.\n\nThe final assessment based on the criteria:\n- The question is not answered by the article.\n- The answer is not well-defined based on the article's content.\n\nThus, the response should be <answer>0</answer> because the criteria for a valid answer are not met, primarily due to the lack of information in the article to support the answer provided.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question, let's go through each segment of the question and then check the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question is about identifying the actor who will portray Dr. Jim Swire in the Sky TV series 'Lockerbie: A Search for Truth'.\n   - **Background:** Dr. Jim Swire is to be portrayed in a Sky TV series, and the casting for this role was not publicly announced as of December 15, 2024.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be the full name of the actor cast as Dr. Swire, as officially announced by Sky TV or reported by major entertainment news outlets.\n   - **Answer:** Colin Firth\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a future event (the casting announcement or the series airing), and it is not in the past tense. The article mentions that the series will be broadcast on Thursday, starring Colin Firth as Dr. Jim Swire. So, the tense is appropriate for the context provided by the article.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article directly states that Colin Firth will star as Dr. Jim Swire in the Sky TV series \"Lockerbie: A Search for Truth\". This information is clear and directly resolves the question. The article serves as a source confirming the casting.\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Colin Firth\" is a name, not a phrase, and it is well-defined and specific. It consists of two words, which is within the acceptable limit.\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer \"Colin Firth\" is not numeric; it is a name. So, it satisfies this criterion.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks the name of a specific actor. \"Colin Firth\" is provided as the answer, and based on the article, it is the correct answer. The article does not suggest there are multiple actors cast for the role, so it implies a single correct answer.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly confirms that Colin Firth is cast as Dr. Jim Swire.\n   - The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n   - The question is resolved by the information provided in the article.\n\nGiven that all the criteria are met (the question's tense is appropriate, the article clearly resolves the answer, the answer is well-defined, non-numeric, and singular), the validation of the answer is positive.\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>1</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To analyze the given question and determine if it meets the specified criteria, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Valid for Forecasting\nThe question is about predicting which actor will portray Dr. Jim Swire in an upcoming TV series. The background states that the casting has not been publicly announced as of the question start date (15th December 2024) and is expected to be announced before the series airs. This indicates the question is forward-looking and valid for forecasting as the resolution date is in the future relative to the start date.\n\n### Step 2: Tense\nThe question is stated in a future tense (\"will portray\"), indicating that the outcome has not yet occurred. Thus, it satisfies the criterion of not being in the past tense.\n\n### Step 3: Single Correct Answer\nThe question seeks the name of a specific actor, implying there's only one correct answer. The casting for a role is typically for one actor, so this criterion is met.\n\n### Step 4: Impact\nThe question pertains to the casting of a character in a TV series about a significant historical event (the Lockerbie bombing). While the impact might be limited to those interested in entertainment news or the Lockerbie bombing, it still has relevance to a specific audience. The impact is moderate but not extremely broad.\n\n### Step 5: Not Binary/Multiple Choice\nThe question requires a free-form string answer (the name of the actor), which satisfies this criterion as it's not binary or multiple choice.\n\n### Step 6: Understandable\nThe question provides sufficient context: it's about an upcoming Sky TV series titled \"Lockerbie: A Search for Truth,\" and it specifies the role in question (Dr. Jim Swire). The resolution criteria are clear, making the question understandable.\n\n### Step 7: Definite Answer\nThe provided answer is \"Colin Firth,\" which is a specific and definite name. It matches the required answer format (full name of the actor). Thus, it satisfies the criterion of being a definite answer.\n\n### Overall Analysis\nThe given question meets all the specified criteria:\n1. It's valid for forecasting.\n2. It's not stated in the past tense.\n3. It has a single correct answer.\n4. It has a moderate impact.\n5. It's not binary or multiple choice.\n6. It's understandable.\n7. The answer provided is definite.\n\nSince there's only one question provided, there's no need for comparison. Thus, the best question is the one given.\n\n### Output\n<q1>\n<question_id>2</question_id>\n<question_title>Which actor will portray Dr. Jim Swire in the upcoming Sky TV series 'Lockerbie: A Search for Truth'?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

Quitting is good\u201d. Others contain a tally of how many cigarettes smoked and the total number of drags taken that day.\nAfter reading the message, participants can swipe it away or press a button to display information about accessing the NHS smoking cessation support pages online.\nChris Stone, of the University of Bristol\u2019s Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, said: \u201cFor those who are trying to give up, an initial lapse is a vulnerable moment, and risks leading to a full relapse to smoking.\n\u201cPeople like smartwatches. They like the idea of it delivering a message at the point that they smoke.\n\u201cTherefore, if we can identify this point of lapse, and deliver an intervention precisely at that point, we have an opportunity to improve the success of the quit attempt.\n\u201cIn carrying out this project, we have aimed to harness the latest thinking in intervention design, and deliver it in a convenient wearable package with minimal burden to the user and maximum engagement with behaviour change; and in doing so, make a difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nIn the study, published in JMIR Formative Research, the smartwatch app was tested on 18 people who were interested in quitting smoking.\nThey wore a TicWatch loaded with the custom app for two weeks, from the moment they woke up until they went to bed, when they were instructed to charge their device overnight.\nThe participants were also advised to remove the smartwatch while showering, swimming or performing any activities that might damage it, such as contact sports.\nAt the end of the two-week period, they sent back the watch and completed a survey consisting of 27 questions.\nIn total, 66 per cent of participants said it was acceptable to wear the smartwatch with the technology, while 61 per cent of those in the study said the content of messages was relevant to them.\nPositive feedback included people reporting that the app raised awareness of smoking, made them feel positive about quitting, made them stop and think, smoke slightly less and it provided constant encouragement.\nNegative responses were that repeated messages lost effectiveness, the message did not appear quickly enough, there was not enough variety of messages and some were vague.\n\u2018Biggest cause of cancer in UK\u2019\nAlizee Froguel, the prevention policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cSmoking is the biggest cause of cancer in the UK and stopping completely is the best thing you can do for your health.\n\u201cThis study shows that smartwatches could be a useful method to help people quit smoking, but more research is needed to understand how effective they are.\n\u201cThere are many tools available to help people quit, and getting support from your free local stop smoking service will give you the best chance of stopping successfully.\n\u201cTo help create a smoke-free future, the UK Government must ensure cessation services are sustainably funded and accessible for all.\u201d\nTo qualify for the study, participants needed to be aged between 18 and 70, and smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day with their right hand.\nPeople with any mobility issues affecting their right hand or arm, or those who used e-cigarettes or any form of nicotine replacement therapy during the study period, were excluded.\nThe researchers believe that their app is the first just-in-time intervention for preventing smoking relapse that runs entirely on a smartwatch and does not need to be paired with a smartphone.\nThey are calling for a longer-term effectiveness trial to be carried out as the next step, which could use a greater variety of messages.\nTheir work is part of the Smoking Cessation theme of the Cancer Research UK-funded Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/smartwatches-could-help-smokers-quit/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 07:21:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:29:12+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>In which academic journal will the University of Bristol's study on a smartwatch-based smoking cessation app be published by January 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The resolution date is expected by January 2025, and the accepted answer format is the full name of the academic journal.\n   - **Answer:** JMIR Formative Research\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in future tense (\"will be published\"), which is acceptable. However, the article mentions that the study \"was published in JMIR Formative Research,\" indicating a past tense publication. This discrepancy is crucial because it directly affects the validity of the answer based on the article's information.\n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article clearly states that the study \"was published in JMIR Formative Research.\" This directly answers the question about the journal in which the study was published. However, the question asks about future publication by January 2025. The article's publication date is not specified, but given that the study was already published in JMIR Formative Research, it implies the study was published before the question's expected resolution date, making \"JMIR Formative Research\" a valid answer regarding the journal's name.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"JMIR Formative Research\" is specific and well-defined, being the name of a journal. It is not more than 3 words in a broad sense but is a phrase. However, it is considered acceptable as it is a proper noun and the name of a journal.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it is a string representing the name of a journal.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks the name of the academic journal. Given that the study was published in JMIR Formative Research, this is a correct answer. The question does not inherently suggest multiple correct answers; hence, it passes this criterion if we consider the context of the article.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The main issue here is the tense of the question (\"will be published\") versus the tense used in the article (\"was published\"). The article confirms that the study was published in JMIR Formative Research. The question's phrasing implies a future event relative to some unspecified date before January 2025, but the article indicates the publication has already occurred.\n   - Since the study was already published in JMIR Formative Research, and this fact is directly stated in the article, the answer is essentially correct regarding the journal's name.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Despite the tense discrepancy, the core of the question (the journal's name) is answered by the article. The answer \"JMIR Formative Research\" is valid, well-defined, and non-numeric. It is the correct journal name as per the article.\n   - However, the question's future tense (\"will be published\") does not align with the article's past tense (\"was published\"). This indicates a potential issue with how the question is framed relative to the information given in the article.\n\nGiven the information and focusing strictly on the criteria:\n- The answer is based on the article.\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n\nHowever, the primary concern is whether the question's future tense aligns with the article's past tense publication. The question is about a future event (publication by January 2025), and the article indicates the publication has already happened.\n\nThus, considering the strict definitions and the fact that the study was indeed published in \"JMIR Formative Research,\" but the question's tense implies a future action, we need to assess if this discrepancy is critical.\n\nThe final assessment should focus on whether the answer directly and unambiguously resolves the question based on the article.\n\nThe best answer is <answer>0</answer> because the question is framed in the future tense (\"will be published by January 2025\"), and the article indicates the publication has already occurred (\"was published\"). This discrepancy makes the validation based on the given criteria not fully aligned, primarily due to the tense issue.", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's analyze the question and the article step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a future event (\"by January 2025\"), which is acceptable as per the criteria. However, the article does not mention any future study or the brand of smartwatch to be used by January 2025. It talks about a study that has already been conducted.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article discusses a study conducted by the University of Bristol where participants wore a \"TicWatch\" loaded with a custom app for two weeks. However, the question is about a future study expected by January 2025. The article does not provide information about future studies or the brand of smartwatch to be used in such studies.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"TicWatch,\" which is a specific brand name and thus well-defined.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is \"string (brand name),\" which is non-numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question is about a specific future study, and if the study details were available, there should be a single correct answer regarding the brand of the smartwatch used.\n\nNow, analyzing the given criteria with respect to the article and the question:\n\n- The article mentions that in the conducted study, participants wore a \"TicWatch.\"\n- The question is about a future study (\"by January 2025\"), which is not discussed in the article.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n1. The question is stated in future tense, which is acceptable.\n2. The article does not resolve the answer to the question because it refers to a past study, not a future one by January 2025.\n3. The answer \"TicWatch\" is well-defined and was used in the past study mentioned in the article.\n4. The answer type is non-numeric.\n5. The question is about a future event not covered by the article, so it cannot be validated against the article's content.\n\nSince the article does not provide information about a future study by January 2025, the answer to the question cannot be validated or derived from the article. Thus, the answer does not meet the criteria of being resolvable by the article.\n\nThe final output should be based on whether all the criteria are met. Since the article does not discuss the future study or the smartwatch brand to be used by January 2025, the most critical criterion (\"Definite resolution of the answer by the article\") is not met.\n\nTherefore, the response should be:\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's analyze the question and the given criteria step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about future funding (\"will fund\") by January 2025. The article is in the past or present tense regarding the funding of the Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme's Smoking Cessation theme. The question's tense is future, which is acceptable, but we need to check if the article provides information about future funding.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that the work is \"part of the Smoking Cessation theme of the Cancer Research UK-funded Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme.\" This indicates that Cancer Research UK is currently funding the programme. However, the question is about who will fund it by January 2025. The article does not provide information about future funding beyond the current state.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"Cancer Research UK,\" which is short (though it has more than one word, it is still considered a specific and well-defined name).\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer is not numeric; it's an organization's name.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific organization. However, the article does not confirm if Cancer Research UK will continue to fund the programme by January 2025; it only confirms current funding.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The article does not provide a definitive answer regarding future funding (\"will fund\") by January 2025. It only confirms that Cancer Research UK is currently funding the programme.\n- The question's resolution criteria mention that the resolution is based on official funding announcements or programme documentation expected by January 2025, which implies the article itself cannot be the source of truth for the future funding status.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question cannot be definitively resolved by the information provided in the article. The article does not guarantee or imply that Cancer Research UK will continue to fund the programme in the future.\n\nHence, based on the criteria that the answer should be sound, clear, and present in or derivable from the article without ambiguity, the question fails to meet the **Definite resolution of the answer by the article** criteria.\n\nThe final output is:\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}
{"title": "Always talking about changing your life? These 8 steps will make it happen", "description": "The human race is hard-wired to avoid change \u2013 so if you want to make a big move, it\u2019s time to get intentional", "maintext": "For some of us, the impetus to make a big life change can come from adversity, a major life event or a lightbulb moment. For Sarah Burghard, it was Asda and the sight of Christmas crackers in October. \u201cI just felt overwhelmed by the inevitable consumerism of the season ahead. The thought of another Christmas season watching TV, eating and drinking too much felt like the road to an uninspiring 2025. I wanted something different\u201d. Within weeks Burghard had moved to Lombok in Indonesia, where she now lives the life of a digital nomad. \u201cI\u2019d fallen in love with the country on previous visits. And that day in Asda was the final straw \u2013 once I got the idea in my head to be there before Christmas, there was no looking back.\u201d\nHow many times have you vowed to do something radical \u2013 especially at this time of year \u2013 only to quietly drop that fervent resolution a few weeks later? In fact, 92 per cent of us will not follow through on a New Year\u2019s resolution. \u201cWe\u2019re hard-wired to feel wariness around change,\u201d says therapist and business psychologist Paula Gardner. \u201cFor our ancestors, moving to an unfamiliar part of the landscape would bring risks, vulnerability and uncertainty, whereas knowing your area and the people around gave you higher odds of survival.\u201d Research shows that one in three of us would avoid change altogether if we could.\nYou have to fight that \u201cBetter the devil you know\u201d urge if you want to bring about change in your own life: so take the following practical steps.\nMake an anti-bucket list\nIf you\u2019re still not 100 per cent sure what shape your big life change should take, start by establishing what you categorically do not want. This gives you clarity and helps you nail your values so you can plan for the future, says Sid Madge, author and founder of the Meee Programme who has worked for some of the world\u2019s largest companies \u2013 and in 2010 walked away from the corporate life in search of new meaning. \u201cYou may have got out of the habit of thinking about what you want, because of life\u2019s responsibilities and the pressure to do the things you think you \u2018should\u2019 do,\u201d he suggests.\nSo, ask yourself: \u201cWhat do I really NOT want in my life any more?\u201d Put all these things on your anti-bucket list. Work in an office full of stressy people? Mountaineering? Learn a language? Once you start eliminating the \u201cno\u2019s\u201d, the whole process becomes much more fertile and creative.\nMaybe commuting is on your anti-bucket list. So, what\u2019s the alternative? Working locally or working from home. The next step is to ask: \u201cWhat skills do I possess to enable me to do that?\u201d And now you\u2019re on a roll with planning for change.\nVisualise your changed life\nPicturing yourself living differently can make it more likely to become reality. \u201cIf you want to work abroad, for example, visualise what your day would be like,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cPicture yourself taking classes to learn the language, booking the accommodation and settling down to work with your laptop at a table on a sunny balcony. If you do some mental rehearsing, you\u2019re more likely to do it for real,\u201d she adds. This is why coaches create mood boards. \u201cIncluding visuals that represent the lifestyle you anticipate \u2013 the locations, the activities, the highlights \u2013 can serve as a constant visual reminder to help motivate you, build momentum and keep your eye on the bigger picture.\u201d\nGetting the end in mind before you start is a surefire method for success, says strategic business consultant Emma Mills-Sheffield. Especially if your goal is to lose weight. \u201cWanting to be the mother of the bride in a particular dress gives you a deadline. But you need to be intrinsically motivated too \u2013 how will I feel if I lose weight/get fit? Is it feeling stronger, healthier, more confident, with more energy to run after the kids? If I can visualise that, I can then work backwards from it and think: \u2018Right, so what will it take to get me there?\u2019\u201d\nDabble before deciding\nThe theory of Possible Selves suggests that there are multiple possibilities for us out there \u2013 you could write that novel, but equally, you could go for that promotion or go back to university part time. \u201cWe don\u2019t choose because it\u2019s frightening to commit, but what if you could just play with those ideas? Rather than setting a goal, you can experiment,\u201d says Gardner.\nSo, if you fancy becoming an aromatherapist, do a short course in aromatherapy to see what it actually entails. Read up on the subject and talk to practitioners, even ask if you can shadow them for the day. You may find you love it or realise it\u2019s not for you. \u201cWhen people set themselves big goals and don\u2019t achieve them there\u2019s the danger of the shame attached to not following through. But experimenting means you aren\u2019t fully committing, just trying it on for size,\u201d says Gardner. Dabbling can give you certainty that a particular new life plan is right for you, meaning you can move forwards with confidence.\nDo a budget\nMills-Sheffield says the financial planning stage is crucial, whatever your goal may be. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning on leaving an unhappy marriage, don\u2019t just pack a bag and leave. Have you done a financial review, and do you know what you can afford to do? If you can\u2019t leave just yet, is there something you can do to boost your finances, such as get a part-time job to build up some savings?\u201d\nIf you\u2019re planning on launching a business or becoming self-employed, skipping this step can be dangerous. Optimism and confidence may not cut it if you don\u2019t do your research and do a proper business plan. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), around 45 per cent of new businesses fail during their first five years, with lack of financial planning being a major cause. For Burghard, her new lifestyle is infinitely more affordable than her old one. \u201cLiving in Lombok costs a tenth of the price of living in Bristol. My lifestyle is so much better than in the UK, but my rent is just \u00a3170 a month.\u201d\nDo it incrementally\nMaking a radical change is of course risky, and not everyone is in a position to do so. But change can be incremental rather than total and immediate, says Madge. \u201cPeople try to change too much, and then they give up. Resolutions are hard to sustain. But you can use incremental change to gradually make a bigger one.\u201d\nFor Katherine and Skip Khangurra, 41 and 56, from Windsor, launching their business, Libra Fine Arts, has been done in a manageable way so they can still afford to pay the bills. \u201cAfter years of working in high-pressured jobs as aircraft dispatchers and the stress of clinging onto our jobs during the Covid pandemic, the move to launching our own business while remaining part-time in our jobs has given us peace of mind \u2013 and embracing a better work-life balance has been such a joy,\u201d says Katherine. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that feeling of someone else pulling the rug out from under my life when my job was on the line, so this gives me a sense of control while doing something I love.\u201d\nBe methodical\nFor Sandy Lancaster, 56, from Chiswick, a big career change was a huge leap of faith. \u201cI longed for a career that felt more aligned with my interests and passions. Retraining as a colour analyst and personal stylist, selling the family law firm and trusting in my ability to succeed independently has been one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d\nLancaster\u2019s career change was carefully thought through and planned. \u201cThe only way I could do it was methodically, first researching, then investing in training, then building my client base from scratch. I leveraged my corporate background to create my business plan and used the downtime during lockdowns to build my social media presence and network.\u201d\nResearch needs to be thorough if you want a realistic view of what\u2019s ahead. \u201cAt your research stage, do the \u2018boring bits\u2019\u201d, says Mills-Sheffield. \u201cSo, if your plan is to move to the seaside, go and spend a few weeks there in the winter and do the boring day-to-day tasks instead of only going when it\u2019s sunny and spending all day on the beach. Go when it\u2019s rainy and you\u2019ve got to do a big shop at the supermarket.\u201d\nMake connections\nBurghard took some essential steps to help pave the way for her Indonesian adventure. \u201cJoining a Facebook community group and posting for social and business connections, I met an estate agent who helped me find an apartment and a variety of really friendly expat and local women who gave me encouragement and information about working visas and areas to live.\u201d These connections have been key to her move being a success.\nFor Katherine Khangurra, making vital connections was a game-changer. \u201cAt first, we made a lot of mistakes, but we soon learnt from talking to people at craft fairs and asking questions. We made friends and useful connections. After a year of doing trade shows, we\u2019re now on sale in 30 shops in the UK.\u201d\nFind social support\n\u201cThe naysayers who question how you\u2019re going to earn your income if you quit your job think they\u2019re speaking from a well-meaning place, but often they\u2019re piling on the doubt because of not wanting things to change,\u201d says Gardner.\nBusiness psychologist Jess Baker says that negative vibes make our self-doubt kick in. \u201cAll it takes is for someone to ask an awkward question that pinpoints something we\u2019re not quite comfortable with about this life change, and we\u2019re in a self-critical tailspin.\u201d So find social support among people in a similar situation, with whom you can have a shared language and understanding.\n\u201cI threw myself into networking groups \u2013 places where I could connect with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and learn from others who were also carving out their own paths,\u201d says Lancaster. \u201cThese groups became my lifeline.\u201d Whatever your goal, accountability really helps, so find someone to help keep you on track and share the highs and lows with. \u201cWe try and do too much by ourselves, but if we have a running buddy to help us achieve fitness goals, it\u2019s incredibly motivating to have them to answer to, knowing we\u2019ll be in trouble if we bail on them,\u201d says Mills-Sheffield.\nMarina Gask is co-founder of Audreyonline.co.uk, the platform for entrepreneurial women", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/talking-about-changing-life-eight-steps-make-it-happen/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:29:18+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Where will Sarah Burghard relocate to by the end of 2024?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 1st December 2024.

The question is stated in future tense, which is acceptable.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article mentions that Sarah Burghard had moved to Lombok in Indonesia before Christmas (implied to be Christmas of the year she felt overwhelmed by consumerism in Asda, seeing Christmas crackers in October). The article does not provide a specific year for her move but indicates it happened after she felt the urge to change her life. Since the article does not directly state that this move is happening in 2024 or that it is her future plan from the time of the article's writing, we need to infer based on the context. However, the background of the question suggests that the move is being considered or has been considered around the time relevant to the question (end of 2024). The article actually indicates that she had already made the move to Lombok, Indonesia, implying it was in the past relative to the article's publication.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"Lombok, Indonesia,\" which is short, concrete, and well-defined. It fits the format requested.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"Lombok, Indonesia\" is not numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific location. \"Lombok, Indonesia\" is a specific location. However, the concern is whether this is the correct answer based on the article and whether it's the only possible answer.\n\nGiven the information in the article, Sarah Burghard had already moved to Lombok, Indonesia. The question asks where she will relocate to by the end of 2024. If we consider the article's content as the basis, it implies the move has already happened. Therefore, the question's premise might be considered flawed or not directly answered by the article because it implies a future action (relocating by the end of 2024) that the article suggests has already occurred.\n\nHowever, focusing on the criteria:\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- It is a specific location.\n\nBut the critical issue is whether the article directly supports the answer as the future action (relocation by end of 2024) or if it indicates she has already done so. The article indicates she had moved to Lombok, Indonesia, which aligns with the answer but suggests it was a past action relative to the article.\n\nThus, the main issue here is the **Tense and Details** and **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**. The question is about a future action relative to a certain date (December 2024), but the article describes a past action. Without knowing the exact publication date of the article or the specific timeline of Sarah Burghard's move, we can't directly validate the future tense of the question against the article's content.\n\nSince the article states that she \"had moved to Lombok in Indonesia\" and \"now lives the life of a digital nomad,\" it implies the move was in the past relative to the article. If the article was written before December 2024, the question's future tense (\"will relocate\") doesn't align with the article's past tense (\"had moved\").\n\nTherefore, the answer cannot be validated as correct based on the given criteria because the question's future tense does not match the article's past tense, indicating a potential mismatch in the timeline.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the given question, let's go through each segment and the criteria provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question asks for the name of the fine arts business launched by Katherine and Skip Khangurra.\n   - **Background:** Katherine and Skip Khangurra from Windsor are launching their business while working part-time, aiming for a better work-life balance.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on the official launch announcement or public business registry. The accepted answer format is the exact, official name of the business.\n   - **Answer:** Libra Fine Arts\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a specific event (launching a business) and is not under-specified. Although the question is not in the past tense in the article (since the article itself is the source and it is in the past tense when referring to the event), the information is directly available. The article mentions that Katherine and Skip Khangurra have launched their business, Libra Fine Arts. So, this criterion is met as the article provides a clear statement about their business.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article directly states that Katherine and Skip Khangurra launched their business, \"Libra Fine Arts.\" Thus, the answer is sound, clear, and present in the article. This criterion is met.\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Libra Fine Arts\" is a specific name and is not more than 3 words. It is concrete and well-defined. This criterion is met.\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a string representing a business name. This criterion is met.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question pertains to a specific fact (the name of the business launched by Katherine and Skip Khangurra). The article provides a single, correct answer: \"Libra Fine Arts.\" There's no indication that there could be multiple correct answers. This criterion is met.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly mentions \"Libra Fine Arts\" as the name of Katherine and Skip Khangurra's business.\n   - All the given criteria are met: the question is clear and not under-specified, the answer is directly derivable from the article, the answer is well-defined and not numeric, and there is a single correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the provided answer is valid according to the given criteria is affirmative.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's go through each segment of the question and the criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** What major asset will Sandy Lancaster sell as part of her career change in 2024?\n   - **Background:** Sandy Lancaster from Chiswick is planning a major career change to retrain as a colour analyst and personal stylist.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on credible sources or official statements by Sandy Lancaster, resolved by December 31, 2024, and should be a short, specific phrase indicating the type of business or property sold.\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in future tense (\"will sell\"), which is acceptable. However, the article is in past tense, discussing what Sandy Lancaster has already done. The question's tense implies a future action relative to the question's start date (1st March 2024), but the article does not provide information about future actions beyond its publication or writing.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article mentions that Sandy Lancaster \"selling the family law firm\" was part of her career change. This directly answers what she has done as part of her career change. However, the question asks about what she \"will sell\" in 2024. The article does not directly state future actions relative to 2024; it simply reports on her past actions.\n\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"family law firm\" is short (3 words), specific, and well-defined.\n\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is not numeric; it's a string indicating an asset type.\n\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks a specific asset type. The article provides a clear answer regarding Sandy Lancaster's actions.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article provides information about Sandy Lancaster's career change, including that she sold her family law firm as part of this change. \n   - The question is about a future action (\"will sell\") relative to a specific date (implied to be after 1st March 2024), but the article's context implies actions taken in the past.\n   - The tense discrepancy between the question (future tense relative to March 2024) and the article (past tense) is critical. The article does not directly address future actions relative to 2024.\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly states that Sandy Lancaster sold her family law firm as part of her career change. This matches the answer provided.\n   - However, the question's phrasing implies a future action (\"will sell\"), and there's an implicit assumption that the article's information is relevant to the future date mentioned (2024).\n\nGiven the details and the criteria:\n- The **Tense and Details** criterion is not fully met because the question implies a future action, while the article discusses past actions. There's a potential mismatch in the timeline.\n- The **Definite Resolution by the Article** is partially met because the article directly states that Sandy Lancaster sold her family law firm, which is a clear and indisputable fact from the article.\n- The **Well-defined Answer**, **Non-Numeric**, and **Single Correct Answer** criteria are met.\n\nHowever, the primary issue here is the tense and the implication of future action in the question versus the past tense used in the article. The article does provide a clear answer to what Sandy Lancaster has done, which aligns with the answer \"family law firm.\" The critical aspect is whether this past action is considered relevant to the question about a future date.\n\nSince the article does provide a clear and direct statement about Sandy Lancaster selling her family law firm, and this is the most relevant information available, one might argue that the essence of the question is answered by the article. However, the question's future tense and the article's past tense create a discrepancy.\n\n**Output:**\nGiven the criteria and focusing strictly on them, the most significant issue is the tense discrepancy and whether the article's past tense actions are considered relevant for a question about future actions.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question, we need to analyze the given question based on the provided criteria.\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the name of the fine arts business launched by Katherine and Skip Khangurra. The start date is 1st June 2024, and the resolution date is December 31, 2024. The time horizon is approximately 7 months, which is more than a single day. The question is forward-looking as it pertains to an event happening between the start date and the resolution date. Thus, it is valid for forecasting.\n\n2. **Tense**: The question is stated in a future-looking manner (\"will be the name\"), not in the past tense. So, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks the exact, official name of the business. There can be only one correct name for the business as registered or publicly announced. Thus, it has a single correct answer.\n\n4. **Impact**: The question is about a specific business launch by named individuals. The impact or relevance of the business name might be limited to those directly involved or interested in the fine arts sector. However, without more context on the expected scale or significance of the business, it's hard to gauge the broader impact. Let's consider this aspect later.\n\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a free-form string answer (the business name), not a binary or multiple-choice response. So, it meets this criterion.\n\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient context about the individuals involved and the type of business they plan to launch. The resolution criteria are clear, making the question understandable.\n\n7. **Definite Answer**: The provided answer is \"Libra Fine Arts.\" It is a specific, definite name, not a range or vague description. Thus, it satisfies the criterion for a definite answer.\n\nGiven that the question satisfies all the criteria, we now need to consider if there are other questions to compare it with.

That is nearly 10 times higher than in 1998/1999.\nAnaemia caused by vitamin B12 or B9 (folate) deficiencies also led to 3,490 hospital admissions in 2023/24, up four-fold from the turn of the century.\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt is very concerning that cases of nutrition-related anaemia serious enough to warrant hospital admission have seen such a substantial increase over the past 25 years.\n\u201cThe near 10-fold rise in admissions for patients with a diagnosis of iron deficiency and a four-fold increase in folate deficiencies \u2013 primarily caused by a lack of nutrition in the diet \u2013 is particularly troubling.\n\u201cWhile treatable with supplements or dietary changes, it comes with the risk of complications \u2013 in children, iron deficiency can be detrimental to development and has been linked to poorer attainment at school.\u201d\nSymptoms of iron deficiency include being very pale, irritability, fatigue, increased heart rate, sore or swollen tongue, and enlarged spleen. The condition can cause heart failure if left untreated.\nOverall the NHS prescribed 804,936 courses of treatment for iron deficiency anaemia, up from 721,650 the year before.\nThe figures show there were also 2,630 admissions for B vitamin deficiency (other than folate), up 15 per cent on the previous year and more than triple levels in 1998/1999.\nSymptoms of vitamin B deficiency can vary but include fatigue, muscle problems, breathlessness, headaches, pale skin, vision problems and heart palpitations.\nThe NHS issued more than 260,000 treatments for vitamin B deficiency in 2023/2024, an increase of 11 per cent.\nThe data further showed 486 courses of treatment involved people with vitamin C deficiency, up from 338 the previous year, while 773 involved a lack of calcium, up from 758.\nProf Hawthorne said the link between overall health and nutrition is \u201cwell established\u201d and a \u201cpoor diet can increase a patient\u2019s risk of developing certain health conditions, while also exacerbating existing conditions\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cWe have seen fresh, healthier foods spike in price over the last few years, making a nutritious diet increasingly unaffordable for some, while \u2018fast foods\u2019 are cheap, are filling and easy to access, but are low in nutritious content.\n\u201cGPs are on the front line of this public health crisis, caring for patients who are experiencing the health consequences of growing deprivation.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that a developed nation like the UK should see an increase in the number of conditions that can be linked to poverty and poor nutrition and yet this is the reality.\u201d\nA recent survey of Royal College of GPs members found that 74 per cent have seen an increase in the number of presentations linked to poverty over the past year.\nResponding to the figures, a government spokesman said: \u201cLord Darzi\u2019s report laid bare the poor health of our nation, which is putting pressure on our NHS services.\n\u201cOur 10-year health plan will shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention and will include action to ensure people have access to a healthy and balanced diet.\n\u201cThrough the Plan for Change, we will fix the foundations of the country to ensure everyone lives healthier lives for longer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/vitamin-deficiencies-surge-hospital-admission-poverty-nhs/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 06:47:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:29:24+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the most common nutrient deficiency leading to hospital admissions in the UK for the 2023/2024 financial year?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The answer format should be the specific nutrient deficiency with the highest number of hospital admissions.\n   - **Answer:** The provided answer is \"iron deficiency.\"\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about the 2023/2024 financial year, which is in the past relative to the question start date (15th December 2024). Thus, it is not in future tense and is specific.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article states there were 191,927 NHS admissions for conditions caused by iron deficiency in 2023/2024. It also mentions admissions for other deficiencies like vitamin B12 or B9 (folate) deficiencies (3,490 admissions) and B vitamin deficiency (2,630 admissions). The data clearly indicates that iron deficiency had the highest number of admissions among the mentioned nutrient deficiencies for the 2023/2024 financial year. Thus, the answer can be derived from the article.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"iron deficiency\" is short (2 words), concrete, and well-defined. It is not a phrase and refers to a specific nutrient deficiency.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is a string representing a nutrient deficiency, not numeric.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** Based on the data provided in the article, \"iron deficiency\" is the correct answer as it had the highest number of hospital admissions (191,927) compared to other mentioned deficiencies. The question does not have multiple distinct correct answers based on the information given.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The question is specific and refers to a past period (2023/2024 financial year).\n   - The article provides the necessary data to resolve the question.\n   - The answer \"iron deficiency\" is well-defined and matches the required format.\n   - The answer is not numeric.\n   - \"Iron deficiency\" is the sole correct answer based on the data provided.\n\nGiven that all the criteria are met, the validation of the answer is positive.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 0, "q2_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid, let's go through each segment of the question and the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question is asking for the name of the UK government's long-term health plan announced in early 2025.\n   - **Background:** The UK government is set to announce a new strategy for the NHS focusing on prevention rather than just treatment.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on an official UK government announcement naming the plan.\n   - **Answer:** \"10-year health plan\"\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in future tense (\"will be the name\"), which is acceptable. However, the article does not mention the plan being announced in early 2025; it mentions \"Our 10-year health plan\" in the context of a current or recent government statement.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article does contain a reference to the \"10-year health plan\" as part of a government spokesman's statement, indicating a plan to \"shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention.\" However, the article does not directly state that this plan is to be announced in early 2025. The resolution criteria specified in the question imply a future announcement, which is not directly supported by the article.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"10-year health plan\" is short and specific, adhering to the criteria of not being more than 3 words.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question implies there should be a single, official name for the plan. The article does provide a specific name (\"10-year health plan\"), which is used in the context of a government plan.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article does mention \"Our 10-year health plan\" in the context of shifting healthcare focus from sickness to prevention, which matches part of the background and resolution criteria of the question.\n   - However, the question's specifics about the announcement being in early 2025 are not directly supported by the article. The article presents the \"10-year health plan\" as part of a current or recent government statement, not a future announcement.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The article does provide a name (\"10-year health plan\") that matches the question's request for the name of a plan related to shifting healthcare focus.\n- However, the timing (\"announced in early 2025\") mentioned in the question is not supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, the main issue lies in the tense and the specific details about the future announcement. The article does not confirm that the \"10-year health plan\" is to be announced in early 2025; it simply mentions it as part of a government statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the article does not directly support the future tense aspect of the question regarding the announcement date, and given that the resolution criteria emphasize an official announcement expected in early 2025, the answer cannot be definitively validated based on the provided article.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate whether the answer to the question is valid based on the provided article, let's analyze the question and the given criteria step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is stated in the future tense, referring to a major news report in early 2025. The article, however, is about events and data from 2023/2024 and prior years. The question's future tense is acceptable according to the criteria.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article quotes Prof Kamila Hawthorne as the chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, expressing concern about rising nutrition-related hospital admissions. However, the question is about a future event (early 2025) and whether she will be quoted in a major news report at that time. The article does not provide information about future events or news reports. Therefore, the article does not resolve the answer to the question definitely.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"Prof Kamila Hawthorne,\" which is short (less than 3 words are not required but it's concise), concrete, specific, and well-defined.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is string (name), which is not numeric.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific name, implying a single correct answer. However, the uncertainty lies in whether Prof Kamila Hawthorne will still be the chairwoman in early 2025, which the article does not confirm.\n\nGiven these considerations, the primary issue is that the article does not provide information about future events (specifically, news reports in early 2025). Therefore, it cannot definitively resolve the question.\n\nHence, based on the criteria that the article should resolve the answer definitely and in an indisputable manner, the question fails the **Definite resolution of the answer by the article** criteria.\n\nThe final output should be:\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question based on the given criteria, let's analyze the provided question step by step.\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the most common nutrient deficiency leading to hospital admissions in the UK for the 2023/2024 financial year. The question start date is 15th December 2024, and it resolves based on the official NHS data release expected by early 2025. The time horizon from the start date to the resolution date is at least a few weeks, which is more than a single day. The question is forward-looking from the perspective of the start date. Thus, it is valid for forecasting.\n\n2. **Tense**: The question is stated in a future-looking manner (\"What will be...\"), not in the past tense. It implies that the outcome has not yet occurred, so it passes this criterion.\n\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks the \"most common nutrient deficiency,\" which implies there is a single correct answer based on the official NHS data. The resolution criteria specify that the answer must be the specific nutrient deficiency with the highest number of hospital admissions, ensuring a single correct answer. Thus, it meets this criterion.\n\n4. **Impact**: The outcome of this question will be relevant to public health officials, policymakers, and the NHS, as it identifies a significant health concern (the most common nutrient deficiency leading to hospital admissions). This information can inform public health strategies and resource allocation. Therefore, it has a considerable impact.\n\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a free-form string answer (the name of a nutrient deficiency), not a binary or multiple-choice response. Thus, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient context: it specifies the geographical region (UK), the financial year (2023/2024), and the source of the data (NHS). The resolution criteria clarify how the question will be resolved. Therefore, the question is understandable.\n\n7. **Definite Answer**: The provided answer is \"iron deficiency,\" which is a specific, well-defined nutrient deficiency. It is not a range or a vague term, meeting the criterion for a definite answer.\n\nGiven that the provided question meets all the specified criteria, and since there's only one question to analyze, it is considered the best question.\n\n**Output:**\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the most common nutrient deficiency leading to hospital admissions in the UK for the 2023/2024 financial year?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

{"title": "Osamu Suzuki turned his family firm into major manufacturer of cheap cars and motorbikes", "description": "The autocratic and famously frugal Suzuki boss flew economy class and cut back on air-conditioning in his factories", "maintext": "Osamu Suzuki, who has died aged 94, was the longest-serving head of a global automotive marque, having built his adoptive family\u2019s business into a major manufacturer of small cars and motorcycles.\nThough outranked in its home market by the likes of Nissan and Toyota, Suzuki Motor Co greatly expanded its international profile under Osamu Suzuki\u2019s forceful leadership from 1978 to 2016. His most successful gambit was in India, where a joint venture in 1981 with the state-backed Maruti company made Suzuki the first large-scale foreign investor in what had hitherto been a closed and somewhat backward domestic industry.\nMaruti Suzuki grew to be India\u2019s largest auto maker, with a dominant share of the affordable small car and commercial vehicle sector, despite rising competition from Tata and others. By 2007, the Indian government having gradually sold its stake, the venture was a wholly-owned Suzuki subsidiary; in recent years, half of Suzuki\u2019s global output of more than 3 million vehicles have been sold in India.\nMeanwhile, Osamu Suzuki bolstered his broader ambitions by securing alliances with General Motors in the US and Volkswagen of Germany, though both came to grief. GM acquired a stake in Suzuki which grew to 20 per cent but was sold off to raise cash as GM itself slid towards bankruptcy in 2009; Volkswagen came in as a replacement investor, but the relationship soured and was unwound in 2015.\nThe Suzuki company traced its origins to 1909, when Michio Suzuki, son of a cotton farmer, began manufacturing looms for the silk industry in the coastal town of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka province. As export demand for Japanese silk declined in the late 1930s, Suzuki began to develop a prototype small car \u2013 and in the postwar industrial recovery, the company turned to manufacturing the low-cost Suzulight model, powered by a 360cc two-stroke engine, and a range of motorcycles.\nMichio Suzuki was succeeded by his son-in-law and adopted son Shunzo, who in accordance with Japanese custom took the family surname to perpetuate the business. Likewise, Osamu Matsuda \u2013 born at Gero in Gifu prefecture on January 30 1930 \u2013 became Osamu Suzuki at the time of his arranged marriage to Shunzo\u2019s daughter Shoko and his entry into the company in 1958.\nAfter graduating in law from Chuo University in Tokyo, Osamu had first worked in a bank and reportedly harboured political ambitions. But he dedicated himself to the auto business and rose to be its president from 1978 to 2000, when he moved up to chairman.\nSuzuki was an autocratic and plain-spoken corporate chief: \u2018\u201cIf I were to listen to everybody, it would make things too slow,\u201d he wrote in his memoir I\u2019m a Small-Business Boss (2009). He was also famously frugal, cutting back on air-conditioning in his factories, shifting production capacity from Japan to lower-cost Thailand, and flying economy class himself.\nHis anointed successor was his own son-in-law, Hirotaka Ono, whom he publicly declared to be more able than his son Toshihiro. But Ono died of cancer aged 52 in 2007 and Osamu Suzuki took up the executive reins again the following year, when the company\u2019s profits were suffering from the global recession.\nInvestors became increasingly concerned at the lack of a succession plan, however, after the octogenarian Osamu declared his intention to stay in post \u201cuntil the day I die\u201d. He finally handed over to Toshihiro in 2016, having led a public apology following a scandal over discrepancies in the company\u2019s fuel and emissions testing.\nBut he continued as chairman until 2021 \u2013 declaring himself \u201cfull of life\u201d having played 47 rounds of golf in the preceding year, and \u201ceasily accessible for advice\u201d whenever needed. He is survived by his wife and their three children.\nOsamu Suzuki, born January 30 1930, died December 25 2024", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2025/01/01/osamu-suzuki-car-motorbike-india-japan-manufacturer/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 07:29:30+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Who will be the immediate successor to Osamu Suzuki as the head of Suzuki Motor Co. when he steps down in 2016?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: January 1, 2015.

Thus, it is not in past tense relative to the article's context but is acceptable as it refers to a specific historical event. The question is specific and not under-specified.\n   \n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article states, \"He finally handed over to Toshihiro in 2016, having led a public apology following a scandal over discrepancies in the company\u2019s fuel and emissions testing.\" This directly answers the question, confirming Toshihiro as the successor. Thus, the answer is sound, clear, and present in the article.\n   \n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Toshihiro Suzuki\" is more than three words when including the surname, so it doesn't meet the criteria of being short (not more than 3 words). However, the core part of the name, \"Toshihiro,\" is within the limit, but the full name is often considered as a unit.\n   \n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a name, so it passes this criterion.\n   \n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The article clearly states that Osamu Suzuki handed over to Toshihiro in 2016, indicating Toshihiro is the correct successor. There is no indication of multiple correct answers.\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The question asks for the immediate successor to Osamu Suzuki when he steps down in 2016.\n   - The article confirms Toshihiro Suzuki as the successor in 2016.\n   - However, the answer format requested is the full name, and \"Toshihiro Suzuki\" is provided as the answer, which is 2 words and thus technically within a relaxed interpretation of the \"not more than 3 words\" criterion.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The question is well-specified and refers to a specific event.\n- The answer is clearly derivable from the article.\n- The answer, \"Toshihiro Suzuki,\" is well-defined and not numeric.\n- There's a single correct answer based on the article.\n\nHowever, the strict criteria about the answer being \"not more than 3 words\" is met as \"Toshihiro Suzuki\" is 2 words. \n\nThus, considering all the criteria and the fact that \"Toshihiro Suzuki\" is a valid and the only correct answer based on the article, the response should be validated.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer based on the provided article, let's break down the task into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks for the home country where Suzuki sells half of its global vehicle output in the years following 2015.\n\n2. **Tense and Details**: The question is stated in future tense relative to 2015, which is acceptable. It refers to a condition (selling half of its global vehicle output) that should be met in the years after 2015.\n\n3. **Definite Resolution by the Article**: The article states that \"in recent years, half of Suzuki\u2019s global output of more than 3 million vehicles have been sold in India.\" This directly supports the answer that India is the country where Suzuki sells half of its global vehicle output. Although the article does not specify the exact years considered as \"recent years,\" it implies a period close to or after the time the article was written. The article mentions events and data points up to 2024, indicating that \"recent years\" could refer to the period around or after 2015.\n\n4. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"India,\" which is a single word and a country name, fitting the requirement of being well-defined and not more than 3 words.\n\n5. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"India\" is not numeric; it's a country name, so it satisfies this criterion.\n\n6. **Single Correct Answer**: The article does not suggest that there are multiple countries where Suzuki sells half of its global output. It specifically mentions India as the place where half of Suzuki's global output is sold. Thus, \"India\" can be considered the sole correct answer based on the information given.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is about a condition (selling half of its output) that is directly supported by the article.\n- The answer \"India\" is derived from the article and meets the criteria of being well-defined and non-numeric.\n- The article does not indicate multiple correct answers for the question.\n\nHowever, the resolution criteria specified in the question mention Suzuki Motor Co.'s official annual reports or financial statements and reputable automotive industry analysis reports as the source of truth. The article, while not an official report, provides a clear statement about Suzuki's sales in India. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the article's reference to \"recent years\" aligns with the period \"following 2015.\" Given that Osamu Suzuki died on December 25, 2024, it's reasonable to interpret \"recent years\" as being after 2015. Thus, the article supports the answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article and the criteria for validation:\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer, let's break down the process according to the provided criteria.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a past event and is stated in a way that refers to a specific historical context (\"Following the sale of General Motors' stake in Suzuki Motor Co.\"). The tense used is appropriate for the context (past tense), so this criterion is met.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article states, \"Volkswagen came in as a replacement investor, but the relationship soured and was unwound in 2015.\" This directly answers the question, indicating that Volkswagen was the German automaker that replaced General Motors as an investor in Suzuki, and their partnership was unwound by 2015. Thus, the answer is sound, clear, and present in the article.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"Volkswagen,\" which is a single word and not a phrase. It is concrete, specific, and well-defined. Therefore, this criterion is met.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"Volkswagen\" is not numeric; it is a company name. So, this criterion is also met.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The article clearly identifies Volkswagen as the German automaker that partnered with Suzuki after General Motors and later had its partnership unwound. There is no indication of another German automaker doing so in the given context. Hence, \"Volkswagen\" is the sole correct answer to the question.\n\nGiven that all the criteria are met:\n- The question is appropriately framed and refers to past events.\n- The answer is clearly and definitely resolved by the article.\n- The answer is well-defined and not more than 3 words.\n- The answer is not numeric.\n- There is a single correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the validation of the question and its answer is successful.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question from the given list, we will analyze each question based on the provided criteria.\n\n### Analysis of Question 0\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the immediate successor to Osamu Suzuki as the head of Suzuki Motor Co. when he steps down in 2016. The start date is January 1, 2015, and the resolution date is expected in 2016, making it valid for forecasting as the time horizon is at least a day and is forward-looking.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense; it refers to a future event relative to the start date.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks the full name of the person appointed, implying a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The succession plan of a major company like Suzuki Motor Co. is significant for investors and stakeholders, indicating a considerable impact.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a free-form string (name), so it is not binary or multiple choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear about what is being asked, with sufficient details about the context.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Toshihiro Suzuki\" is definite and well-defined.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the home country where Suzuki sells half of its global vehicle output in the years following 2015. It is forward-looking and has a resolution date after 2015, making it valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single country, suggesting a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The sales distribution of a major automaker is relevant to investors and industry analysts, indicating a significant impact.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires the name of a country, making it a free-form string and not binary or multiple choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"India\" is definite.\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question pertains to an event (a German automaker investing in Suzuki and the partnership being unwound by 2015) that is expected to occur before the resolution date. However, the resolution date is expected to be by 2015, which is in the past relative to the current date, making it not valid for forecasting as per the given context.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense but refers to an event that has already occurred.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The investment and subsequent unwinding would be significant for investors and the automotive industry.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a company name, making it free-form and not binary or multiple choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is understandable but refers to a past event.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Volkswagen\" is definite.\n\n### Comparison and Conclusion\n- Question 0 is valid for forecasting, not in the past tense, has a single correct answer, is not binary or multiple choice, is understandable, and has a definite answer. It has a significant impact due to its relevance to investors and stakeholders.\n- Question 1 is also valid for forecasting, meets the tense criteria, implies a single correct answer, is not binary or multiple choice, is understandable, and has a definite answer. It has a significant impact due to its relevance to the automotive industry and investors.\n- Question 2 is not valid for forecasting because the event it refers to is expected to be resolved by 2015, making it a past event.\n\nBoth Question 0 and Question 1 satisfy all the criteria. However, Question 1 has a broader impact as it pertains to the global sales distribution of Suzuki, which can affect a wider audience including investors, industry analysts, and potentially consumers.\n\nTherefore, the best question is **Question 1**.\n\n### Output\n<q1>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the home country where Suzuki sells half of its global vehicle output in the years following 2015?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: January 1, 2015.

The question's structure implies a single correct answer, so this is more about the validity of the answer rather than the question's capability to have multiple answers.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\nThe critical issue here is that the article does not contain any information relevant to the question about the primary country of origin for Channel small boat crossings in 2024. The answer cannot be derived from the article, failing the **Definite resolution of the answer by the article** criteria.\n\nTherefore, despite the answer being well-defined and non-numeric, the failure to meet the crucial criteria of being resolvable from the article means the validation fails.\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>0</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question based on the provided article, let's go through each segment of the question and then check the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Question Title:** The question asks which European country the UK will finalize a new returns agreement with by the end of 2024.\n   - **Background:** The UK is seeking bilateral agreements with European nations to return irregular Channel migrants.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer is based on an official joint statement or signed memorandum of understanding by the UK and the partner country, reported in major news outlets, to be resolved by December 31, 2024.

Thus, the article does not provide a clear or direct answer to the question.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"France\" is short, concrete, and well-defined, adhering to the specified format.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is a string (country name), not numeric, so it passes this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question is framed to have a single correct answer (the name of one European country), and \"France\" is given as that answer.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The critical issue here is whether the article supports or provides the answer to the question.

Guest editors Floella Benjamin and Sajid Javid offered worrying analysis", "maintext": "It was all thoughtful, intelligent stuff, but it was the domain of January improvement and reflection, not December 27 turkey sandwiches and Gaviscon. As such, I craved a little more jingle in my bells and was delighted to come across An Organ for the Sultan (Radio 3). The church organ is the background noise in my house during the Christmas period, as some radio or other burbles merrily away. Ben Cottam\u2019s programme allowed me to extend that lovely feeling by exploring the life of Thomas Dallam, who built the organ in King\u2019s College Chapel, Cambridge. It was perfect \u201cbetween week\u201d radio (I refuse to call it \u201cTwixmas\u201d).\nDallam, a favourite of Elizabeth I, was given an onerous task \u2013 to build an organ of such magnificence that it would entrance the most powerful man in the world, the leader of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Mehmed III, and entirely transform the international reputation of England and its crown. He also had to get the thing to Constantinople in one piece. Dallam, said one contributor, \u201cpulled out all the stops\u201d.\nIt was an irresistible tale, one of storms, pirates, bribery and a young Lancastrian who embraced the whole endeavour as if he was on a gap year. He climbed mountains when others told him not to, he downed wine from strangers when all else declined (\u201cBest wine I ever drank,\u201d he wrote in his diary), he fixed the waterlogged organ with old spoons. He seemed in constant fear of losing his head (literally). Once inside the Topkapi Palace, the scene was a riot of ritual and spectacle, involving mutes and dwarves and beautiful women. Dallam even became the first Westerner to get a peek of the sultan\u2019s harem.\nIt was a ripsnorting, swashbuckling adventure with a charismatic, charmingly reckless hero at its centre \u2013 you could draw a direct line from Dallam\u2019s diaries to Indiana Jones (ideal \u201cbetween week\u201d movies, incidentally) \u2013 and it is easy to see why the combination of ingenuity and pluck was something Britons took to heart. The sultan was bowled over too, and tried to keep Dallam, something Queen Elizabeth seemed to view as acceptable collateral damage for improved diplomatic relations and open trade routes. The only disappointment was that Dallam faked illness and a family to get home to, rather than escaping the palace in a feat of derring-do.\nSomeone on my wavelength this week was Pete Doherty, singer and guitarist with The Libertines, who appeared on Kirsty Young\u2019s always-interesting interview series Young Again (Radio 4). The conversation was excellent, gently probing and illuminating, but Doherty had no truck with the programme\u2019s central conceit, which is that the guests dispense words of wisdom\nto their younger selves.\nWhen Young pressed him on what he might say to the teenage Pete, Doherty was at a loss: \u201cI\u2019d tell myself who was going to win the Grand National\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an awful lot I could say.\u201d As someone refusing to engage with any kind of self-improvement until January, I was pleased with his stance. He did, however, have one bit of advice. \u201cGet some sleep,\u201d he said.

Thus, it passes this criterion as it's acceptable for questions to be in current or future tense.\n\n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article states, \"The bronze bust was commissioned by the King\u2019s Foundation to mark its 35th anniversary and will be on permanent display at its Dumfries House headquarters in Scotland.\" This directly answers the question about the permanent display location. Hence, the answer is sound, clear, and present in the article.\n\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer is \"Dumfries House,\" which is concise (2 words), concrete, specific, and well-defined. It is not a phrase and fits within the 3-word limit.\n\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a location name. So, it passes this criterion.\n\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The article specifies that the bust will be on permanent display at \"Dumfries House headquarters in Scotland.\" While \"Dumfries House\" is provided as the answer, it is implicitly understood to refer to the headquarters. The question does not have multiple distinct correct answers based on the information given in the article. Hence, \"Dumfries House\" is considered the sole correct answer.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The question is about a future event but is directly supported by the information given in the article.\n   - The answer \"Dumfries House\" is derived from the article and is the only correct location mentioned for the permanent display.\n   - All other criteria (well-defined, non-numeric, single correct answer) are met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given criteria and the information in the article, the answer to the question is valid.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer, let's go through each segment and the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The title asks about the material of the official bust of King Charles.\n   - **Background:** Provides context that a bust is being created for the King\u2019s Foundation's 35th anniversary, expected to be completed in early 2025.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** Specifies that the answer should be based on the material confirmed upon completion or unveiling, expected by March 2025, and should be the primary material used.\n   - **Answer:** Bronze.\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is not in the past tense; it's in a general/neutral form. The background mentions a future event (completion in early 2025), which is acceptable. The article, however, is in the past tense regarding the creation and planning of the bust. **Pass**\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article clearly states that \"The bronze bust was commissioned by the King\u2019s Foundation...\" Thus, it directly answers the question about the material. **Pass**\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Bronze\" is short (a single word), concrete, specific, and well-defined. **Pass**\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer \"Bronze\" is not numeric. **Pass**\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The material of the bust is specified as bronze in the article.

The resolution date is by March 2025. The time horizon from the start date (1st December 2024) to the resolution date (March 2025) is more than a single day, making it valid for forecasting. **Valid**\n2. **Tense**: The question is not stated in the past tense; it refers to a future event. **Valid**\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific location, implying a single correct answer. **Valid**\n4. **Impact**: The outcome could be relevant to those interested in the King's Foundation and its activities, potentially affecting a limited but specific group of people. **Moderate Impact**\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a specific location name, not a binary or multiple-choice answer. **Valid**\n6. **Understandable**: The question provides sufficient details about the context and what is being asked. **Valid**\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Dumfries House\" is specific and definite. **Valid**\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: Similar to Question 0, this question is valid for forecasting as it pertains to the material of the bust to be unveiled in early 2025. **Valid**\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense. **Valid**\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single correct answer regarding the material. **Valid**\n4. **Impact**: Similar to Question 0, the impact is moderate, relevant to those interested in the King's Foundation. **Moderate Impact**\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a specific material type. **Valid**\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable. **Valid**\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Bronze\" is definite. **Valid**\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: This question is about the sculptor of the bust, to be confirmed by early 2025. **Valid**\n2. **Tense**: Not in the past tense. **Valid**\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: Implies a single correct answer, the name of the sculptor. **Valid**\n4. **Impact**: Relevant to those interested in art and the King's Foundation, potentially having a moderate impact. **Moderate Impact**\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: Requires a specific name. **Valid**\n6. **Understandable**: Clear and understandable. **Valid**\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Lily Marsh\" is definite. **Valid**\n\nAll three questions (0, 1, and 2) meet the criteria. Now, we need to assess their impact.\n\n- **Impact Assessment**: All questions have a moderate impact, relevant to a specific audience interested in the King's Foundation and its activities. However, the impact can be considered relatively similar across the questions as they all pertain to the same event (the unveiling of the King Charles bust).\n\nGiven that all questions are valid and have a similar impact, we need to look for any subtle differences or additional factors.\n\n- **Subtle Differences**: Questions 0, 1, and 2 are all about different aspects of the same event. The relevance and interest in these aspects might vary among the audience. However, without specific information on which aspect is more significant or interesting to a broader audience, we consider them equally relevant.\n\nSince all questions are valid and have similar characteristics, the choice among them can be considered arbitrary based on the given criteria.

{"title": "Recession warning signs are already flashing for Britain in 2025", "description": "Grim outlook for year ahead is primarily result of Labour\u2019s policy missteps", "maintext": "Much of the assumed boost from increased government spending, moreover \u2013 particularly when it comes to investment \u2013 is back end loaded, so won\u2019t have much immediate impact. The same goes for the Government\u2019s intended housebuilding boom, which if it happens at all will take some time to get going.\nIn the meantime, the economy has to contend with the damage done to confidence by the Government\u2019s tax raid on business and its package of enhanced workers\u2019 rights.\nThe increase in employers\u2019 National Insurance doesn\u2019t happen until April, but already firms are taking evasive action. Hiring is being slashed, investment plans are being shelved, and many companies will attempt to claw back the increase in costs through higher prices.\nThe international backdrop looks equally bad. The UK economy still tends to move in tandem with the other major economies of Europe, where the outlook is similarly grim.\nIf there is a recession, it will nevertheless largely be one of Labour\u2019s own making, an astonishingly inept outcome for a Government that came to power promising the most pro-business Treasury in history and the fastest rate of growth in the G7.\nInstead, the economy is grinding to a halt, raising the prospect of further growth-stifling tax rises to ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s fiscal rules. The Chancellor\u2019s promise of no more tax rises already looks hollow.\nJust as worrying, inflation is likely to prove stickier than many anticipate, fuelled by higher public sector pay awards, the increased minimum wage, the increase in National Insurance and Trump\u2019s threatened tariff war.\nThis may in turn frustrate the Bank of England\u2019s plans to bring down interest rates, notwithstanding the weakened economic outlook. Higher for longer will continue to be the order of the day.\nThe US Federal Reserve may similarly struggle to cut rates this year, but for rather different reasons. From the threatened tariff war to tax cuts and the mass deportation of immigrants, many of Donald Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary. Higher for longer US interest rates imply a stronger dollar, a weaker pound, and an even weaker euro, which will hit parity against the dollar as the European Central Bank slashes interest rates to support a struggling eurozone economy.\nDon\u2019t make the mistake many commentators made in 2016, at the start of Trump\u2019s first presidency, of assuming his policies doom America to economic catastrophe.\nTrump\u2019s deregulatory agenda alone is sufficient to keep the US economy booming for a while yet. Markets are admittedly already frothy, and valuations look stretched across the board. Rampant growth in largely unregulated private credit is as clear a warning sign as they come of financial excess. And Trump\u2019s promise to further deregulate crypto is an accident waiting to happen if ever there was one.\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump has got no convincing plan for dealing with the deficit, so investors will eventually begin to question the risk free nature of US Treasuries.\nYet all these threats are still some distance off, and I doubt they\u2019ll materialise this year.\nAt some stage markets will crash, but it needs a trigger, and it is for now hard to see what it might be. Most of the US indices will therefore end the year higher than their current values.\nWe have nonetheless almost certainly already seen \u201cpeak Musk\u201d. It is hard to have a conversation these days without some mention of this ubiquitous entrepreneurial dynamo.\nI don\u2019t see him falling out with Trump in some massive clash of egos, as many predict; he\u2019s got too much riding on keeping the president sweet to risk such a confrontation.\nBut the hype around the world\u2019s richest man is now so extreme that he can only really disappoint. Jealous of his success, his rivals in Silicon Valley and beyond are circling, desperate to undermine him.\nIt\u2019s possible that Peter Mandelson, Britain\u2019s new ambassador to Washington, may be able to negotiate a carve-out for the UK from Trump\u2019s universal tariff plan, but it is very unlikely that this would result in a fully-fledged free trade agreement, even if Trump were to propose one.\nTo sign such a deal would be a death blow for a UK agricultural sector already seething with anger over Labour\u2019s inheritance tax assault on family farms. Rightly or wrongly, Labour will continue to prioritise getting closer to Europe over increased economic ties with the US.\nBritain already enjoys a perfectly good trading relationship with the US, and it is not clear that the obligations of a deal largely dictated by American interests would much improve things.\nThis is a column about economics; geopolitics is not my field. Yet the two have become so intermingled in recent years that it is impossible to avoid some assessment of geopolitical events.\nTrump\u2019s re-election on a Make America Great Again, anti-globalist approach to international affairs has obviously turned previous calculations on their head. Yet I wouldn\u2019t bet on what must be the most widely stated prediction for 2025 \u2013 that he\u2019ll successfully impose some sort of shabby peace deal on Russia and Ukraine.\nUnder this scenario, a war-weary and economically crippled Russia would settle for the land already acquired while Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky would, with the threat of US military aid being withdrawn, have no option but to accept.\nThis view has become such common currency that it is now widely seen as inevitable. There is, however, many a slip, and I see no reason why Putin would accept such an outcome.\nAs for the nation of Oceania in George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four \u2013 which sustains its totalitarian regime via a state of permanent war with Eurasia or Eastasia \u2013 endless conflict in Ukraine has become part of Putin\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. For him, \u201cwar is peace\u201d \u2013 a way of keeping himself in power.\nThere\u2019s little sign of Russia\u2019s imminent economic collapse, or of Putin being toppled, which though much predicted in the West is more a case of wishful thinking than an outcome solidly grounded in probability.\nSo on that depressing note, here\u2019s wishing all who have got this far good health and a prosperous new year.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/recession-warning-signs-already-flashing-britain-2025/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 08:16:24+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>When will the increase in UK employers' National Insurance contributions take effect?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The article states, \"The increase in employers\u2019 National Insurance doesn\u2019t happen until April, but already firms are taking evasive action.\" This indicates the question is not in past tense regarding the event's status (since the event is in the future relative to the article's context), and it's specific about the timing.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article clearly states that the increase in employers' National Insurance will happen in April. This directly answers the question and is definite.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"April,\" which is short (less than 3 words), concrete, specific, and well-defined.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"April\" is not numeric; it's a month name, so it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question is about a specific date (month) when an event occurs. The article specifies that the increase happens in April, making \"April\" the sole correct answer based on the information given in the article.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is not in past tense regarding the event it queries.\n- The article directly and clearly answers the question.\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- There is a single correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the provided answer is valid according to the given criteria is affirmative.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer based on the provided article, let's analyze the question step by step and then check it against the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** How will most major US stock indices perform by the end of 2025 compared to their values at the start of the year?\n   - **Background:** The question is set in the context of US stock market indices and their performance in 2025, influenced by various factors.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on the comparison of the closing values of major US stock indices at the end of 2025 versus the start of 2025. The answer format should be a single word indicating the direction of change (higher, lower, or unchanged).\n   - **Given Answer:** higher\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about the future (by the end of 2025), which is acceptable as it's not in the past tense.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article states, \"Most of the US indices will therefore end the year higher than their current values.\" This directly supports the answer \"higher\" as it indicates an expectation of the US stock indices being higher by the end of the year compared to their current values (at the time of writing). Thus, the answer can be derived from the article.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"higher\" is short (a single word), concrete, and well-defined. It fits the required format.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a direction, so it passes this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question is about the direction of change, and while there's always some uncertainty in predictions, the article provides a clear statement that supports \"higher\" as the answer. The article doesn't suggest multiple correct answers; it provides a specific view.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly supports the answer \"higher\" with the statement about US indices ending the year higher than their current values.\n   - All criteria are met: the question is not in the past tense, the answer is derived from the article, it's well-defined, non-numeric, and represents a single correct answer based on the article's content.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the answer to whether the given answer is valid according to the criteria is: <answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question, let's analyze it step by step according to the given criteria.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about the UK Labour government's intention in 2025, which is stated in future tense. The article is discussing the outlook for 2025, so it's relevant. The question is not under-specified and is clear about what it's asking.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article states, \"Rightly or wrongly, Labour will continue to prioritise getting closer to Europe over increased economic ties with the US.\" This directly supports the answer that the UK Labour government will prioritise \"Europe\" for strengthening economic ties in 2025. The article resolves the answer definitely.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer \"Europe\" is short (a single word), concrete, specific, and well-defined. It fits the accepted answer format specified in the resolution criteria.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"Europe\" is not numeric; it's a geographic region. So, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The article clearly indicates that Labour will prioritise getting closer to Europe. While there might be other regions the UK could potentially strengthen ties with, the article makes it clear that Europe is the priority over the US.

The resolution date is by 30th April 2025, and the start date is 15th December 2024, making it valid for forecasting as the time horizon is more than a single day.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not in the past tense; it's forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The answer should be the specific month when the increase becomes effective. Although there could be only one correct month, the question's framing around a specific event (implementation date) suggests it can have a single correct answer.\n4. **Impact**: The change in National Insurance contributions affects employers and potentially employees, having a significant impact on the UK economy and thus being relevant to a large number of people.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The answer is not binary or multiple choice; it's a string (month), which meets this criterion.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear about what it's asking, with sufficient details provided in the background and resolution criteria.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"April\" is definite and not vague or a range.\n\n### Question 2 Analysis\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: This question is about the performance of major US stock indices by the end of 2025. The resolution date is by 5th January 2026, making it valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking, not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The answer indicates the overall direction of change (higher, lower, or unchanged), which could be seen as having a single correct answer based on the average performance.\n4. **Impact**: The performance of major US stock indices affects a large number of people globally, both directly and indirectly, through investments and economic indicators.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: Although the answer could be seen as limited to three options (higher, lower, unchanged), it's still not free-form. However, it can be considered as not meeting the \"Not Binary/Multiple Choice\" in the strictest sense because it implies a limited set of choices.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is understandable, with clear resolution criteria.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"higher\" is definite.\n\n### Question 3 Analysis\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question concerns which geographic region the UK Labour government will prioritize for strengthening economic ties in 2025. The resolution date is by 31st December 2025, making it valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single region will be prioritized, but in reality, multiple regions could be prioritized, making the single correct answer criterion potentially problematic.\n4. **Impact**: The prioritization of economic ties with a particular region can have significant economic and political impacts, affecting a large number of people.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The answer is a string (region), which is not binary or multiple choice in format.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is understandable with sufficient context.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"Europe\" is definite.\n\n### Comparison\n- All questions are valid for forecasting and are forward-looking.\n- None are in the past tense.\n- Questions 1 and 3 have a more specific and singular answer format.\n- All have significant impact, but the impact of Question 1 and Question 2 could be considered broader due to their direct implications on economic policies and stock market performance, respectively.\n- Question 1 and Question 3 meet the \"Not Binary/Multiple Choice\" criterion better than Question 2, as they require a specific string answer rather than selecting from a limited set of options.\n- All questions are understandable and have definite answers.\n\n### Best Question Selection\nGiven the criteria, **Question 1** (\"When will the increase in UK employers' National Insurance contributions take effect?\") is a strong candidate because it meets all the criteria effectively. It's forward-looking, not in the past tense, has a specific answer format, is understandable, and has a definite answer. It also has a significant impact due to its implications for the UK economy.\n\n**Question 2** is close but is somewhat limited by its implied multiple-choice nature (higher, lower, unchanged), which doesn't strictly adhere to the \"Not Binary/Multiple Choice\" criterion.\n\n**Question 3** is also a good candidate as it meets most criteria and has a significant impact. However, the potential for multiple regions to be prioritized could complicate the \"Single Correct Answer\" criterion.\n\nBetween these, **Question 1** stands out due to its clarity, specificity, and adherence to the given criteria.\n\n### Output\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>When will the increase in UK employers' National Insurance contributions take effect?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

Thus, the article does not resolve the answer to the question.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"LED headlights\" is short and specific, consisting of only two words, which is acceptable.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is string (technology), which is non-numeric and thus acceptable.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question implies there should be a single technology identified as the primary cause. However, without the article or any report from organizations like NHTSA or IIHS, we cannot validate if \"LED headlights\" is the sole correct answer.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article's content does not discuss or imply any information about the technology causing glare from vehicle headlights.\n   - The question's resolution criteria depend on a report or study from a specific organization, which is not provided in the article.\n   - The answer \"LED headlights\" cannot be validated or derived from the given article.\n\nGiven these observations, the most critical issue is that the **article does not provide any relevant information to answer the question**.

The most critical failure is against the second criterion: \"Definite resolution of the answer by the article.\"\n\nTherefore, despite the answer being well-defined and non-numeric, the lack of relevant information in the article to support the question or its answer means it fails to meet the necessary criteria.\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>0</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best": 1, "no_good_question": 1}

Then there\u2019s the \u201cMust-have Fashion Buys\u201d.\nStop! Let\u2019s not forget how we are told time and time again how trends are \u201ccyclical\u201d, that fashion looks \u201ccome and go\u201d. This is the time to make some considered wardrobe-related resolutions rather than being triggered to buy more, more, more\u2026\nMy own resolution is this: to ensure I buy for my own tastes, rather than conforming. I\u2019m determined to buy what I love, not what I feel I\u2019m meant to love. No more \u201cof the moment\u201d trainer styles, no more bad-quality jeans, no more multipacks of stripey tops because the price is \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d... This is a whole new level of pondering before purchase. If my approach seems too extreme, take your lead from these style leaders and their own personal resolutions.\nReduce and refine\n\u201cI started reducing my closet size this year, and it\u2019s very cathartic! In 2025, I\u2019m aiming to keep an even more refined capsule wardrobe of tailored pieces that I wear in a variety of combinations. Lovely oversized blazers, a long burgundy pencil skirt from De Savary, thin cashmere polo-necks layered underneath bigger cable-knit pieces. I\u2019m aiming to accessorise them with 90\u2019s-inspired gold earrings from YSSO and Orelia.\u201d\nLOUISE ROE, presenter and founder of Sharland England\nWhisper of the Wind earrings, \u00a3320, YSSO\nA soup\u00e7on of timeless French chic\n\u201cI find this so hard! I am absolutely obsessed with clothes, a real passion of mine, but I think I would like to add a bit more colour in 2025 and I would like to get out of leggings and change from the gym for the day rather than stay in them! I have always been obsessed with the French look so I am hoping to channel that even more. I have actually been collecting some little neck scarves as I want to wear these a bit more. My whole wardrobe is French-girl-meets-cowboy-in-the-1970s with a touch of 80s thrown in.\u201d\nJOOLS OLIVER, writer and childrenswear designer\nGaston scarf, \u00a325, S\u00e9zane\nSort out your lingerie drawer\n\u201cNew year is the perfect time for a wardrobe detox, starting with your lingerie drawer! Did you know 80 per cent of British women wear the wrong bra size? A well-fitted bra can improve your posture, alleviate back pain, as well as boosting self-confidence and promoting skin health (our Nudea Fit Tape allows you to measure at home and is ideal for checking your size every six months).\n\u201cWith the average British woman owning 20 bras but wearing just five, it\u2019s little wonder 19 million bras end up in landfill annually. That\u2019s why we offer a recycling scheme for old or ill-fitting bras to highlight the importance of responsible shopping.\n\u201cFor a versatile \u2018bra-drobe\u2019, we suggest one nude, one black, and one coloured bra for variety, along with different briefs to avoid VPL (visible panty line) and maximise styling options year-round.\u201d\nPRIYA DOWNES, chief executive officer and founder of Nudea\nThe Boss full cover bra in Bare 07, \u00a348 reduced to \u00a310, Nudea\nDon\u2019t edit out personality\n\u201cI need more personality in my wardrobe. While buying just five things a year is an incredible sartorial (and financial) discipline, I found this year I strayed too far into boring sensible territory. For 2025, three of my items will be outrageous, talking-point pieces! First stop will be A Perfect Nomad, an independent British designer whom we stock in our Ibiza store, AGORA.\nHer designs are relaxed, her fabrics all natural, (her silk hemp mix is gorgeous, durable and breathable), but the finishing is elevated and super cool. I bought a pair of her gold cargos two years ago and they work from Shoreditch to Santa Gertrudis. She is doing a wide leg leather pant this spring which looks ace, and is vegetable-tanned and chrome-free lamb leather. But I also love the look of the black crochet floor length skirt... Could I? Should I?...!\u201d.\nTIFFANIE DARKE, founder of Rule of Five\nLace skirt, \u00a3240, A Perfect Nomad\nInvest in elevated basics to make your wardrobe work harder\n\u201cI\u2019m finally going to invest in one or two excellent pairs of jeans. I wear a With Nothing Underneath (WNU) shirt and jeans most days and have never really taken the time to find the perfect cut, so I\u2019m on the hunt.\n\u201cI have invested in a few pairs of smart boots and hope to kick my trainer habit. I became very lazy in my footwear when it came to outfitting and I am looking forward to elevating my WNU looks with a sharp boot in the start of 2025.\u201d\nPIP DURELL, founder and chief executive officer of With Nothing Underneath\nThe dress shirt, \u00a3175, With Nothing Underneath\nBring a sense of intention (and a planning mindset!) to your work outfits\n\u201cI\u2019m not usually one for fashion resolutions or planning my wardrobe in advance, but with a packed schedule in 2025 (travelling up to two weeks a month) I know I need a wardrobe that supports and empowers me \u2013 rather than becoming the source of frustration.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be leaning into my boyish androgynous side. There\u2019s something about the clean lines of a tailored suit or the sharpness of a smart jacket that instills confidence in me. Next year, as I step into hosting retreats and delivering numerous speaking engagements, I want my wardrobe to amplify that sense of empowerment. I think of suits as more than just clothing; they\u2019re a declaration of intent.\u201d\n\u201cSustainability matters deeply to me, and that means prioritising timeless, high-quality garments over fleeting trends. I now buy fewer pieces, focusing instead on quality and longevity and in 2025, I will purchase only items that I believe will remain a staple in my wardrobe for years.\n\u201cAs for colour? I\u2019ve been known to cycle through entire seasons clad in black, but 2025 will be different. I\u2019ve finally discovered how energising and uplifting color can be, and I\u2019m committed to embracing my favourites \u2013 red, blush cornflower blue and buttermilk. Whilst I\u2019m not big on prints, I do love checks and stripes.\n\u201cEven though I have spent my career in the fashion industry, it is only now that I have come to a profound realisation: my fashion goals need to align with my life goals and my choices in clothing need to embody the same values I strive for in my life \u2013 intentionality, sustainability, and authenticity.\u201d\nDALBIR BAINS, executive coach, entrepreneur and founder of Santalan\nPatch pocket jacket in bluebell, \u00a3850, Victoria Beckham\nIf you do one thing\u2026 add an earcuff\n\u201cA strong ear game can totally change the look of an outfit. Cuffs not only work with almost everything but you can edit and play with the look by stacking them up depending on the vibe you are going for\u2026.\n\u201cWear one on one ear and nothing else for an understated chic, everyday feel. Add to it and it becomes an evening look which is so impactful, incredibly comfortable but statement.\u201d\nCHRISTIE AND ROSANNA WOLLENBURG, co-founders of Otiumberg\nMan\u2019s coat in bronze khaki wool mohair, \u00a33,800, Phoebe Philo\nFind a bag that\u2019s fit for purpose\n\u201cI do genuinely have a resolution\u2026 Getting my act together for my work wardrobe. As a mum of a two-year-old and a four-year-old, all my clothes have got some kind of stain before I leave the house, my coat pockets and bags are laden with crumbs, toys, or something random and sticky at the bottom that I find stuck to my laptop as I pull it out in an important meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWhilst I don\u2019t want to hide being a mum at work I would like to feel a little more \u2018together\u2019, so I am purchasing myself a bag, a laptop case, a make-up bag and a pencil case. It will remain strictly for work only and will also serve as a way to physically put my work away when I get home so I can be present with the kids.\u201d\nAMY POWNEY, creative director of Mother of Pearl.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/style-resolutions-2025-according-to-fashion-insiders/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 08:30:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 09:00:14+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What accessory will Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg recommend adding to an outfit in 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: December 15, 2024.

This is acceptable.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article contains a quote from Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg, where they recommend adding \"an earcuff\" to an outfit. Thus, the answer is present and clear in the article.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"an earcuff\" is short (2 words), concrete, and well-defined.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a type of accessory.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks a specific accessory recommended by Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg. The article clearly states that they recommend \"an earcuff.\" There's no indication of multiple correct answers.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly quotes Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg recommending \"an earcuff.\"\n   - The answer matches the resolution criteria (1-3 words, specific accessory).\n   - The tense is appropriate for the context (future recommendation).\n\nGiven that all criteria are met, the validation is successful.\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>1</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the given question and its answer, let's go through the required criteria step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about Pip Durell's plans for 2025, which is in the future relative to the date mentioned in the background (December 15, 2024). The article is about style resolutions for 2025, so it's reasonable that the question is in the future tense relative to the background date but is answered based on the article's content which is already about 2025 resolutions. Thus, the tense is appropriate for the context.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article directly quotes Pip Durell stating, \"I'm finally going to invest in one or two excellent pairs of jeans.\" This directly answers the question about what specific clothing item she plans to invest in for her daily wardrobe in 2025. The article provides a clear and indisputable answer.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"excellent pairs of jeans.\" This is a phrase, not a single word or a very short phrase (1-3 words as suggested by the resolution criteria). However, it directly reflects the content of the article. A more concise version could be \"jeans,\" which is within the 1-3 word limit.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is not numeric; it's a clothing item, so it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question is specific to Pip Durell's resolution for 2025, and the article provides a clear statement about her intention to invest in \"one or two excellent pairs of jeans.\" While there could be a range of interpretations, the core answer is \"jeans\" or \"excellent pairs of jeans,\" which is directly derived from the article. The question doesn't seem to have multiple distinct correct answers based on the information given.\n\nHowever, the provided answer \"excellent pairs of jeans\" is a phrase and slightly longer than the recommended 1-3 words. A more concise answer like \"jeans\" would be within the limit and still be correct and specific enough given the context.\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n- The question is appropriately framed in terms of tense.\n- The article provides a clear and direct answer to the question.\n- The answer, while a bit lengthy, directly corresponds to the information in the article. A more concise version (\"jeans\") would be more appropriate.\n- The answer is not numeric.\n- The question does not have multiple correct answers.\n\nTo strictly follow the format and criteria, the answer should be concise (1-3 words). \"Jeans\" is a valid concise answer that is directly supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, considering the criteria and focusing on the essence of the validation process, the response should be evaluated based on whether the answer is faithful to the article and meets the specified criteria.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about Dalbir Bains' plans for 2025, which is in the future relative to the date mentioned in the background (December 15, 2024). The article is about style resolutions for 2025, so it's reasonable that the question is in the future tense relative to the background date. The article is the source, and it discusses plans for 2025, so the tense is appropriate.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article provides a quote from Dalbir Bains where she mentions, \"I'm going to be leaning into my boyish androgynous side. There's something about the clean lines of a tailored suit or the sharpness of a smart jacket that instills confidence in me.\" This directly supports the answer that she intends to wear \"suits\" more for her professional engagements, as it aligns with her goal of amplifying her sense of empowerment.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"suits,\" which is short (1 word), concrete, specific, and well-defined.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer \"suits\" is not numeric; it's a type of garment.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question asks for the type of garment Dalbir Bains will wear more for her professional engagements. The article specifies \"suits\" as part of her resolution, indicating a clear intention. While she also mentions \"smart jacket,\" the question's answer format allows for a single type of garment. \"Suits\" is a correct answer based on the information given, and it directly relates to her professional engagements.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The question is appropriately framed regarding tense.\n- The article directly supports the answer \"suits.\"\n- The answer is well-defined and not numeric.\n- While Dalbir Bains mentions other garments like \"smart jacket,\" the primary garment type emphasized in relation to her professional engagements and confidence is \"suits.\" The question does not fail the single correct answer criterion solely because there is a related but distinct mention (\"smart jacket\"), as \"suits\" is a clear and direct answer based on the text.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the question is valid is affirmative.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question from the provided list, I will analyze each question based on the given criteria.\n\n### Analysis of Question 0\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg's recommendation for 2025, with a resolution date of January 1, 2025. The time horizon from December 15, 2024, to January 1, 2025, is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking and not in the past tense.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific accessory, implying a single correct answer based on their public recommendations.\n4. **Impact**: The impact is moderate, as it relates to fashion recommendations that could be relevant to their followers or the fashion industry.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question is not binary or multiple choice; it requires a specific accessory as the answer.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable, providing sufficient context about Christie and Rosanna Wollenburg.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"an earcuff\" is definite and specific.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about Pip Durell's investment in her daily wardrobe for 2025, with a resolution date of January 1, 2025. The time horizon is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question implies a single correct answer based on Pip Durell's public statements.\n4. **Impact**: Similar to Question 0, the impact is moderate, related to fashion.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a specific clothing item, not binary or multiple choice.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is understandable, with sufficient context about Pip Durell.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"excellent pairs of jeans\" is somewhat vague due to the adjective \"excellent,\" but it is still specific in terms of the clothing item.\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question concerns Dalbir Bains' professional attire for 2025, with a resolution date of January 1, 2025, making it valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is forward-looking.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: It implies a single correct answer based on Dalbir Bains' public statements.\n4. **Impact**: The impact might be slightly less than Questions 0 and 1 since it is more specific to her professional engagements.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a specific type of garment.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and provides sufficient context.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The answer \"suits\" is definite and specific.\n\n### Comparison\nAll three questions meet the criteria:\n- They are valid for forecasting.\n- Not stated in the past tense.\n- Imply a single correct answer.\n- Are not binary or multiple choice.\n- Are understandable.\n- Have definite answers.\n\nGiven that all questions are similar in terms of meeting the criteria and are related to fashion/style recommendations for 2025, the impact becomes a key differentiator. Questions 0, 1, and 2 have moderate impact due to their relevance to the fashion industry and the individuals' followers.\n\nSince the impact is somewhat similar across the questions and they all satisfy the given criteria, any of them could be considered the \"best\" based on slightly different interpretations of \"impact.\" However, given the information and the need to choose one, I will select one based on the clarity and specificity of the answer and the question details.\n\n### Best Question\nLet's choose **Question 2** as it has a very specific and clear answer (\"suits\"), and the context provided is straightforward.\n\n**Output:**\n<q1>\n<question_id>2</question_id>\n<question_title>What type of garment will Dalbir Bains wear more for her professional engagements in 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: December 15, 2024.

{"title": "What is chrono-fasting and can it help with weight loss?", "description": "This new diet encourages us to eat healthy foods earlier in the day. But how does it work \u2013 and do the benefits extend beyond weight loss?", "maintext": "If you\u2019ve spent the past few weeks starting the day with a Quality Street at 7am and finishing off with a mince pie at midnight, you are probably desperate to give your body a rest and shift that festive flab.\nWhen it comes to cutting calories, the path of least resistance is often to skip a meal. For many, it\u2019s breakfast which gets the heave-ho, especially on a time-restricted diet plan which limits the time you can eat to eight or 10 hours a day.\nBut the latest scientific research reveals eating later in the day could lead to weight gain. By ignoring our circadian rhythm \u2013 our internal clock which tells us when to eat and when to sleep \u2013 we\u2019re storing up a host of health problems.\nChrono-fasting is a new wellness trend which aims to bring our eating habits back in line with our body clock. But how does it work?\nWhat is chrono-fasting?\nChrono-fasting is a time-restricted diet based on the principles of chrono-nutrition \u2013 which is \u201cthe study of how our circadian rhythm and nutrition interrelate,\u201d says Rhian Stephenson, a nutritionist and the founder of supplement brand Artah.\nStephenson explains: \u201cOur internal clock, like a master clock, maintains a daily rhythm. This influences essential processes such as hormone release, energy levels, sleep, hunger, repair and regeneration. Our body has distinct functions throughout the day whether it be digestion, problem-solving, physical activity or an ability to respond to stress.\u201d\nThe aim is to eat in the \u201cbiological day\u201d and let the body rest in the \u201cbiological night\u201d. Instead of eating between, for example, 8am and 8pm, eat between an early time-restricted window, having breakfast between 7am and 8am and dinner by 4pm or 5pm. Front-load calories early in the day: eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper, and make sure each meal has a good balance of fibre, protein, fat and phytonutrients.\nA 2022 meta-analysis of studies found dieters who consumed a greater proportion of their calories in the morning lost more weight than those who had more calories at dinner, possibly because of better alignment with their circadian rhythm.\nBenefits of chrono-fasting\n1. It\u2019s better for our metabolic health\nThe same meta-analysis found early eaters had lower levels of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, blood sugar and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, a 2020 meta-analysis of studies found insulin and blood sugar levels were higher after the same meal was eaten between 8pm and 4am, than between 7am and 4pm \u2013 while eating carbs in the evening is known to spike blood sugar levels compared to the morning. All of that means eating early in the day helps with weight loss as we\u2019re less likely to reach for a sugary snack to give ourselves a boost.\n2. It\u2019s better for recovery\nWe all know that sluggish feeling we get in the morning when we\u2019ve gone to bed on a full stomach. Stephenson says: \u201cWhen we sleep, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol and various other hormones allow time for extensive physical and emotional recovery; our muscles, organs and cells repair, our immune system is strengthened, and our cognitive function is restored.\u201d\n3. It\u2019s good for keeping us regular\nThe most common time to empty our bowels is after breakfast. Dr Emma Derbyshire, a public health nutritionist from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, says: \u201cYou are most likely to go to loo in the morning \u2013 waking up triggers gut motility. But if your body clock gets disrupted, it can lead to constipation.\u201d\n4. It\u2019s easier to keep the weight off\nOne 2011 study found that dieters who ate more in the morning continued to lose weight even after coming off their calorie-controlled diet, while those who ate more in the evening put weight back on.\nIs chrono-fasting better than intermittent fasting?\nTime-restricted diets are a type of intermittent fasting. But there are other methods of intermittent fasting such as the 5/2 approach where you eat around 500 calories each day for two days a week. The problem is consuming such a small amount of calories on two days of the week runs counter to the principles of chrono-nutrition \u2013 especially if you save that up for dinner.\nStephenson explains: \u201cChrono-fasting may be helpful for people suffering from chronic stress \u2013 especially perimenopausal females \u2013 because if you wake up and don\u2019t eat until 12, you can exacerbate that stress.\u201d\nPlus, we may actually alter our sleep times if we eat too late. A 2024 German study which compared early and late time-restricted eating found that eating later in the day altered the circadian body clock, causing a delay in sleep timing. Those on the earlier plan also felt hungrier in the morning.\nHow to follow a chrono-fast diet\nEating within a shorter window is known to lower the amount of calories consumed - plus, there\u2019s no snacking in front of the television in the evening. The balance of food you eat is important: a breakfast of cornflakes isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cEvery meal should be high-protein and high in fibre: you\u2019re aiming to get 25g of protein and 20g of fibre into each meal, so you\u2019re still well nourished,\u201d says Stephenson.\nDr Derbyshire reiterates the importance of fibre in our daily diets: \u201cNone of us are eating enough fibre,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all need to get at least 10g more a day.\u201d She suggests oat-based breakfasts with yogurt to boost protein levels and seeds, and making sure you include white meat, fish, eggs or cheese at lunch, alongside fresh veg and salad and wholegrains.\nFor example, 250g of Greek yogurt for breakfast will give you around 25g of protein. Chicken offers 27g of protein per 100g and salmon 25g. Foods with 6g of fibre per 100g are called high-fibre foods and include lentils and wholegrain cereals.\nTips to help with chrono-fasting\nIf you\u2019re a night owl, bring the eating window forward in the day, but consider starting at 10am and finishing at 6pm or at the latest by 7pm. But bear in mind 70 per cent of us are actually \u201cbears\u201d \u2013 neither a lark nor an owl. Plus, says Stephenson, while our chronotype is influenced by our genes, \u201cour circadian rhythm is not, and you can train it \u2013 as we do when we fly to a different time zone\u201d.\nDo it in January. The hours of daylight we currently have match the suggested window of eating perfectly: when it gets dark at 4pm your body will naturally start getting ready for bed. Stephenson says: \u201cAt this time of year people are willing to stop drinking alcohol, one of the biggest disruptors of sleep, circadian rhythm and the gut microbiome.\u201d\nPreparation is key. Eating a good breakfast takes planning and Dr Derbyshire suggests, \u201cPreparing some overnight oats before you go to sleep. Feeling time-poor in the morning is a reason people skip breakfast.\u201d\nWhat to eat for lunch in the office\nIf you are working from home, then making a bigger lunch than usual shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But if you\u2019re in the office and usually eat lunch on the go, Dr Derbyshire suggests, \u201cEither pack a lunch (a light sandwich made with wholemeal bread and packed with protein and salad would work well) or choose a shop-bought salad which has a balance of protein, fibre and a wholegrain like quinoa.\u201d\nPlan your dinner. Having soup at 4pm or 5pm if you\u2019re working in the office can be tricky but make it the night before and take it in a thermos rather than resort to a shop-bought soup. Dr Derbyshire adds: \u201cPlus, it\u2019s good if you are restricting calories in any way to take a multivitamin each day.\u201d\nThe chrono-fast diet plan\nStephenson\u2019s supplement brand Artah is launching its own post-Christmas diet reset diet that lasts for three weeks. Stephenson says: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to lose half a stone following the chrono-fast. The absence of sugar, alcohol, and ultra processed food combined with a focus on fibre, protein, and phytonutrients should lead to weight loss. As long as you\u2019re following the core foods and the meal-timing principles, you\u2019ll get great results. \u201d\nWeeks one and three\nThe average daily calorie intake in weeks one and three is around 1,500-1,600kcal per day, with the option to increase portion size depending on your goals and activity level.\nWeek two\n\u201cCalorie intake during the chrono-fast is between 1,000-1,200kcals. Calorie intake is front-loaded in the day with around 450-550kcal for breakfast and lunch, and then for it\u2019s soup (180kcal) or a broth (50kcal) [depending which plan you\u2019re on]. There\u2019s a \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 mid-way through the week, where people can eat one of our suggested meals in the evening should they need it.\u201d\nFAQs\nHow long does the chrono-fast last?\n\u201cFollow the strict chronofast for seven days only \u2013 and make sure you rest and recover while you do so,\u201d says Stephenson\nCan I drink alcohol on the chrono-fast?\nNo: alcohol disrupts sleep and wreaks havoc on our body clock, so ditch it for this diet.\nWhat if I can\u2019t eat until later?\nIf you can\u2019t do it perfectly, then just do what you can. If you can\u2019t have the soup until 7pm, this is fine as the calories are negligible.\nCan I exercise while I\u2019m doing the seven-day chrono-fast?\nGive a hard training schedule a swerve and focus on a week of yoga and breathwork, plus don\u2019t train hard in the evening. Artah are running on demand and weekly live sessions of yoga as part of the plan.\nIs the chrono-fast a calorie-controlled diet?\nCalorie intake might be lower than your usual diet but Stephenson says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to eat five almonds and a few grapes. It\u2019s about eating good quality meals and understanding how much the timing of what you eat can impact your health.\u201d\nHow can I adapt it to everyday life once I\u2019ve done the fast?\n\u201cYou can follow the principles of chrono-nutrition in your daily life. Aim for eating earlier and to finish eating by 7pm three or four days a week, or at weekends if that\u2019s easier,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stick to it every day \u2013 we all have social lives!\u201d\nRecipes\nProvided by Artah\nBreakfast\nSpiced Shakshuka", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/chrono-fasting/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 09:00:20+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Which supplement brand will launch a post-Christmas chrono-fasting diet reset program by January 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The resolution date is 31st January 2025, and the answer should be the full name of the supplement brand.\n   - **Answer:** The provided answer is \"Artah\".\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is stated in the future tense (\"will launch\"), which is acceptable. However, the article does not explicitly mention the launch date being by January 2025; it only talks about a post-Christmas diet reset.\n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article mentions that \"Stephenson\u2019s supplement brand Artah is launching its own post-Christmas diet reset diet that lasts for three weeks.\" This directly supports the answer \"Artah\" as the supplement brand launching a post-Christmas diet reset program. However, the article does not specify the launch date, which is crucial for confirming it will be by January 2025.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"Artah\" is short (less than 3 words), concrete, specific, and well-defined.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is not numeric; it's a brand name, so it satisfies this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** Given the information in the article, \"Artah\" is presented as the specific brand launching a post-Christmas diet reset. There's no indication of multiple correct answers.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The article confirms that \"Artah\" is launching a post-Christmas diet reset diet.\n   - However, the exact launch date is not specified in the article. The assumption that it will be by January 2025 is not directly supported by the article.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question's resolution criteria include a resolution date of 31st January 2025, but the article does not provide information about the launch date relative to this.\n   - While \"Artah\" is a well-defined answer and matches the information given in the article about launching a post-Christmas diet reset, the article does not confirm if this launch is by January 2025.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most critical issue is whether the article definitively resolves the question regarding the launch by January 2025. Since it doesn't explicitly state the launch date, there's an ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided criteria and focusing on the \"Definite resolution of the answer by the article,\" the answer cannot be validated as the article does not confirm the launch date.\n\nThe final answer is <answer>0</answer>.", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question based on the provided article, let's go through each segment of the question and the criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** What chronotype will be reported as the most common among people in chrono-fasting guidance by January 2025?\n   - **Background:** The question discusses chrono-fasting and circadian rhythm alignment, categorizing individuals into chronotypes like \"larks,\" \"owls,\" and \"bears.\"\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on credible sources, resolved by January 2025, and should be a single-word chronotype.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Article:**\n   - The article discusses chrono-fasting, its benefits, and how to follow it. It mentions that \"70 per cent of us are actually 'bears' \u2013 neither a lark nor an owl.\"\n\n3. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a future date (January 2025), which is acceptable as per the criteria since it's not in the past tense.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article directly states that \"70 per cent of us are actually 'bears',\" which clearly indicates that \"bears\" are the most common chronotype. This information is present and clear.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"bears\" is short (a single word), concrete, and well-defined.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a chronotype name.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks the most common chronotype, and the article provides a clear answer, \"bears,\" which is the sole correct answer based on the information given.\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   - The article directly answers the question by stating that 70% of people are \"bears.\"\n   - The answer \"bears\" meets all the specified criteria: it's based on the article, well-defined, non-numeric, and the single correct answer.\n\nHowever, the question's resolution date is January 2025, and the article does not provide a date for its information. The task, though, is to validate the answer based on the article's content.\n\nGiven that the article supports the answer \"bears\" and it adheres to the criteria, we need to consider if the future date (January 2025) affects the validation. The article is relevant and provides the necessary information.\n\nThus, based on the information provided in the article and adhering to the specified criteria, the validation of the answer is positive.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 0, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer, let's go through each segment and the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** What beverage will be explicitly prohibited in the chrono-fasting diet plan by January 2025?\n   - **Background:** Chrono-fasting is a time-restricted eating plan emphasizing alignment with the body's circadian rhythm. Certain foods and drinks may be restricted.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The answer should be based on publicly available diet plans or credible reports on chrono-fasting that list prohibited beverages by 31st January 2025. The answer should be a single word or short phrase.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Article:**\n   - The article discusses chrono-fasting, its principles, benefits, and how to follow the diet. It mentions that alcohol disrupts sleep and wreaks havoc on our body clock and is thus prohibited during the chrono-fast diet.\n\n3. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is in the future tense (\"will be prohibited\"), which is acceptable. However, the article is in the present or general tense regarding the prohibition (\"alcohol disrupts sleep and wreaks havoc on our body clock, so ditch it for this diet\"). The question's future tense might imply a need for a future or specific plan detail.\n   - **Definite Resolution by the Article:** The article clearly states that alcohol is to be avoided during the chrono-fast diet. However, it does not explicitly state this in the context of \"by January 2025.\" The resolution criteria mention a resolution date of 31st January 2025, but the article does not provide a specific timeline for the diet plan's start or end.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"alcohol\" is short (1 word), concrete, and well-defined.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer type is not numeric; it's a string (beverage name), so it passes this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The question seeks a single beverage name. The article does not suggest multiple beverages being prohibited, so \"alcohol\" can be considered the sole correct answer based on the information given.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Answer:**\n   - The article does mention that alcohol is prohibited during the chrono-fast diet. However, the question's phrasing (\"by January 2025\") introduces a timing that is not directly addressed in the article. The article provides general guidance on the chrono-fast diet without specifying future dates or changes to the diet plan.\n   - The answer \"alcohol\" is directly supported by the article, but the timing aspect of the question (\"by January 2025\") is not explicitly covered.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The main issue here is whether the article's information about prohibiting alcohol during the chrono-fast diet is considered valid \"by January 2025.\" Since the article does not provide a specific timeline or indicate that the prohibition on alcohol will change, and given that the diet plan mentioned is to start post-Christmas (implying December) and last for three weeks, the relevance of \"January 2025\" is not directly addressed.\n   - The article does not provide a diet plan specifically for January 2025, making the question's future tense and specific date potentially problematic.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most critical issue is that the article does resolve the answer (\"alcohol\") clearly and it is well-defined, non-numeric, and a single correct answer. However, the question's specific reference to \"by January 2025\" is not directly supported or refuted by the article.\n\nSince the article is current and does not specify changes or a timeline that would contradict the prohibition on alcohol, and considering the essence of the question is about the beverage prohibited (which is clearly answered as \"alcohol\"), one might argue it still fulfills the criteria due to the lack of any indication that the rules would change.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, the question's future tense and the specific date (\"by January 2025\") are not directly validated by the article, which does not provide a future perspective or timeline that matches the question's specifics.\n\nTherefore, based on the strict interpretation of the criteria and focusing on the fact that the article does not directly address the future date specified in the question, the response should be evaluated for its adherence to the given format and the criteria.\n\nThe best answer is <answer>0</answer>.", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question from the provided list based on the given criteria, let's analyze the given question step by step.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Question\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**:\n   - The question is about the most common chronotype reported among people in chrono-fasting guidance by January 2025.\n   - The start date is 15th December 2024, and the resolution date is 31st January 2025, making the time horizon more than a single day.\n   - The question is forward-looking from the start date to the resolution date.\n   - **Valid for forecasting**: Yes.\n\n2. **Tense**:\n   - The question is stated in a future-looking manner and does not imply that the outcome has already occurred.\n   - **Tense is appropriate**: Yes.\n\n3. **Single Correct Answer**:\n   - The question seeks the most common chronotype as per credible publications or reports by January 2025.\n   - The answer is expected to be a single chronotype (e.g., \"larks\", \"owls\", \"bears\").\n   - Although there could be multiple reports, the question implies a singular answer based on the most common chronotype reported.\n   - **Single Correct Answer**: Yes, assuming the reports converge on a single chronotype.\n\n4. **Impact**:\n   - The outcome could be relevant to individuals interested in chrono-fasting and understanding their circadian rhythms.\n   - It might have implications for health and dietary advice, potentially affecting a significant number of people interested in these areas.\n   - **Impact**: Moderate to High, depending on the popularity and relevance of chrono-fasting guidance.\n\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**:\n   - The question is not binary or multiple-choice; it requires a specific chronotype as an answer.\n   - The answer type is specified as a string (chronotype), which is not binary or multiple-choice.\n   - **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: Yes.\n\n6. **Understandable**:\n   - The question provides sufficient context about chronotypes and chrono-fasting.\n   - The resolution criteria are clear, specifying the source of truth, resolution date, and accepted answer format.\n   - **Understandable**: Yes.\n\n7. **Definite Answer**:\n   - The provided answer is \"bears,\" which is a specific and definite chronotype.\n   - The answer format is as per the resolution criteria (a single-word name of the chronotype).\n   - **Definite Answer**: Yes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe given question meets all the specified criteria:\n- It is valid for forecasting.\n- It is not stated in the past tense.\n- It implies a single correct answer.\n- It has a moderate to high impact.\n- It is not binary or multiple-choice.\n- It is understandable.\n- It has a definite answer.\n\nSince there is only one question provided, it is considered the best question by default.\n\n### Output\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>What chronotype will be reported as the most common among people in chrono-fasting guidance by January 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

Although this doesn't directly state that \"bears\" is the most common chronotype, it does mention \"bears\" explicitly. However, the mere mention of \"bears\" as a category does not necessarily constitute leakage since it's part of the context. The background also doesn't give away the answer directly; it's just providing categories. Thus, \"No leakage found\" in the background because it doesn't directly reveal \"bears\" as the most common chronotype.\n\n3. **Check the resolution criteria**:\n   - **Source of Truth**: This segment talks about credible publications, expert statements, or mainstream media reports specifying the most common chronotype.

{"title": "'I earn \u00a312k and scrimp to send my child to private school", "description": "Parents who are far from wealthy face a stark choice as fees rise", "maintext": "Monica works part-time as a pupil support worker at an academy where she earns less than \u00a312,500 a year. With the help of Universal Credit, she is able to pay her \u00a3720 rent each month and send her son to one of the most affordable private schools in Britain where fees are \u00a35,600 a year.\nEven with a bursary, which reduces the fees to \u00a33,360, Monica has cut back on every expense imaginable to help give her son the best start in life. From January 1, her fees will rise to over \u00a34,000 thanks to Labour\u2019s education tax. She is hoping to keep her son at his school but doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019s going to find the money.\n\u201cMy life is embarrassingly simple,\u201d she says. \u201c We don\u2019t have a television so I don\u2019t pay for a TV licence, Netflix or any of that. If we watch something, it\u2019s on YouTube or we rent library DVDs.\n\u201cThe heating goes on twice a day to warm the flat to 18.5 degrees. It\u2019s terribly cold at times, but we try to use the principle of heating the person rather than the space.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mobile phone contract. I use pay-as-you-go because it costs me \u00a35.60 per month. I\u2019ve had the same phone for the past eight years. It\u2019s a pain because now it\u2019s really slow and there are certain websites you cannot open any more. But that\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe most valuable things Monica owns are her 10-year-old computer which she worries she cannot afford to replace and their second-hand car which she uses in the summer holidays to go hiking with her children.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any luxuries. We don\u2019t go to the theatre or the cinema, I can\u2019t afford it. I need to save all the money I have so my son can go to his school,\u201d she says.\n\u2018State school wasn\u2019t an option\u2019\nYou might wonder why someone with such little means chooses to spend more than a third of her income on private education. For Monica, the answer comes immediately. The memories of her older daughter\u2019s experience at state school are still raw.\nHer daughter, now aged 20, attended one of Aberdeen\u2019s most successful state schools, an academy that was known for its impressive exam results. However, rather than thriving at the school, her daughter was singled out because of her financial background.\nMonica says: \u201cMost of her classmates came from the totally opposite background with totally different values. They were very wealthy families where children got whatever they wanted.\n\u201cThere were lots of drugs and smoking involved and my daughter just did not feel included and the school did nothing at all.\n\u201cThere was huge peer pressure to have the right mobile phone. She would say \u2018Why can\u2019t I have this jacket or this bag that the others have?\u2019 Why can\u2019t I have these shoes\u2019.\n\u201cAnd I understand that feeling when you are that age. But I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t want to spend \u00a3150 on a pair of trainers.\n\u201cThere was zero support at the school and she left with one qualification because Covid hit. Luckily her life has completely changed since. She\u2019s had so many positive experiences and can see the world is not so bad as it was at that school.\u201d\n\u201820pc rise is a lot to me\u2019\nWhile her daughter is now going to college and has turned her life around, Monica will do everything in her power to make sure her son does not have the same experience.\n\u201cIn mainstream schools they put you in a box. Everybody needs to be the same, to think the same. There is no encouragement for critical thinking,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBut since the second my son started going to his school, he has loved it. I remember we went for a trial day two months before he started and when we left he said \u2018Mum, can I go already tomorrow\u2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half now since he joined and there has not been a single day where he\u2019s said \u2018Mum, I don\u2019t want to go to school\u2019. He is taught in a class of 10 and it\u2019s a wonderful environment.\u201d\nBut despite his success, Monica is stuck. The school told parents earlier this month it would have to raise its fees by 20pc meaning Monica now needs to find \u00a34,032 to keep her son at his school.\n\u201cThe stress of potentially having to uproot my child from school where he is thriving is overwhelmingly sickening, and it\u2019s putting his future, and our stability, at risk.\u201d\nA \u00a3672 increase is relative for everyone. For Sir Keir Starmer, who earns almost 14 times more than Monica, it is roughly equivalent to one day\u2019s wages. But for Monica, who has sacrificed every luxury in life, there is nothing more she can trim from her vigilant budgeting to make up the shortfall.\nLabour\u2019s attack on lower-paid hard workers\nAnd while you might think a low-paid single mother is exactly the type of person Labour claims to represent, it\u2019s the Government\u2019s own policies that have made her predicament worse.\nHer landlord has decided it is no longer viable to let the property and told Monica last month that he has decided to sell the three-bed flat meaning she needs to find somewhere new to live.\nBut despite increased regulation and taxes forcing thousands of landlords out of the market, prices aren\u2019t coming down. Similar properties are up to \u00a3600 more expensive to rent each month than what Monica currently pays and she says the chance of getting a deposit and then a mortgage \u201cin the current circumstances\u201d is impossible.\nThe obvious solution might be to work more hours \u2013 currently, Monica works 14 and a half hours each week. But the cost of childcare is now so expensive she has calculated that if she applied to work full time, she would be left with less money after paying for a childminder to drop off and pick up her son each day.\nFor Monica, the extra work simply doesn\u2019t pay. It means she\u2019s stuck in a choice between downsizing, although the two-bed flats she\u2019s been looking at are between \u00a3850 and \u00a3900 and therefore still more than she\u2019s currently paying, and applying for council housing, which she fears she won\u2019t get.\nThe reality is, Monica isn\u2019t an outlier. Her case as a private school parent is far more common than the Labour government wants to accept.\nAround 90,000 private school pupils come from below-median-income households and a further 116,000 from outside the top two deciles.\nIt is those families that Labour\u2019s VAT raid will disproportionately affect. \u201cI came to this country for a better life,\u201d Monica says. \u201cBut it really isn\u2019t much better any more.\u201d", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/scrimp-send-child-private-school-vat-raid-sickening/", "date_publish": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "date_modify": null, "date_download": "2025-01-01 09:00:27+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Which UK political party's tax policy will cause a private school fee increase starting January 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.

The article, however, discusses the current situation and a future increase in fees due to a tax policy change. The relevant information is that \"From January 1, her fees will rise to over \u00a34,000 thanks to Labour\u2019s education tax.\" Although the exact date mentioned is January 1 ( likely referring to the year the article is discussing, not 2025), it implies Labour's policy is the cause of the fee increase. The article's context suggests it is discussing the impact of Labour's education tax, aligning with the question's future tense regarding 2025. However, the article does not directly mention January 2025; it mentions January 1, implying a current or near-future year.\n\n2. **Definite resolution of the answer by the article**: The article attributes the increase in Monica's private school fees to \"Labour's education tax.\" This directly supports the answer that the Labour Party's tax policy is the cause of the fee increase. The article clearly states this, making the answer derivable from the content.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer \"Labour\" is short, concrete, and specific. It is not more than 3 words and is a well-defined name of a political party.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric**: The answer type is a string representing a political party, not a numeric value. Thus, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks the name of the political party responsible for the tax policy causing a private school fee increase. The article clearly attributes this to Labour, suggesting that \"Labour\" is the correct answer. There is no indication in the article of multiple correct answers regarding the political party responsible.\n\nHowever, there's a discrepancy between the date mentioned in the article (January 1, implying the year the article is discussing) and the question's date (January 2025). The article does not directly confirm the policy's impact in January 2025. \n\nGiven this, the main issue lies in the **Tense and Details** and the **Definite resolution of the answer by the article** because the article does not explicitly mention January 2025. The article's context and the question's specifics about the year 2025 do not align perfectly due to the date mentioned (January 1).\n\nSince the article does not directly confirm the Labour Party's tax policy effect in January 2025 and the question's resolution criteria rely on confirmation by January 2025, the answer cannot be definitively validated based solely on the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, considering the criteria and the details provided in the article, the response should be based on whether the article directly supports the question's specifics.\n\n<answer>0</answer>", "q2_valid": 1, "q2_validation_response": "To validate the answer to the question, let's go through each segment of the question and the given criteria.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n- The question is about determining the new annual fee amount for Monica's son's private school after the January 2025 increase.\n- The background mentions a fee increase effective from January 2025.\n- The resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on the official communication from the school or a reputable news report, and it should be resolved by 31st January 2025.\n- The accepted answer format is a precise annual fee amount in British pounds.\n\n**Analyzing the Article:**\n- The article discusses Monica's struggle to pay for her son's private school education.\n- It mentions that Monica's son's school fees are currently \u00a33,360 after a bursary, and they will rise to over \u00a34,000 from January 1 due to Labour's education tax.\n- Later, it is mentioned that the school is raising its fees by 20%, resulting in a new fee of \u00a34,032.\n\n**Checking the Criteria:**\n\n1. **Tense and Details**: The question is about a future event (January 2025), but the article provides information about a fee increase happening in January (implied to be January 2025, though the year is not directly stated in the article, the context suggests it's referring to a near future date from the perspective of the article). The article actually refers to an increase happening from January 1, and given the context, it seems to be talking about a near future date. The exact year isn't specified, but based on the content and the fact that it discusses Labour's policies and their current impact, we can infer it's discussing a contemporary or near-future scenario. The question is not in the past tense.\n\n2. **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article**: The article clearly states that the school is raising its fees by 20%, and Monica now needs to find \u00a34,032 to keep her son at the school. This directly answers the question about the new annual fee amount.\n\n3. **Well-defined Answer**: The answer provided is \"\u00a34,032\", which is specific, concrete, and matches the required format of being a currency amount.\n\n4. **Non-Numeric (though the answer is numeric, it's in a currency format which is acceptable as per the question's context)**: The answer type is a string representing a currency amount, which aligns with the accepted answer format specified in the resolution criteria.\n\n5. **Single Correct Answer**: The article provides a specific figure (\u00a34,032) as the new fee, indicating there's a single correct answer to the question about the new annual fee amount.\n\n**Validation:**\n- The question is about a future event but is grounded in information provided in the article.\n- The article clearly states the new fee amount as \u00a34,032.\n- The answer is well-defined and in the correct format.\n- The answer is not numeric in the sense that it's a simple number; it's a currency amount, which is what's required.\n- There's a single correct answer based on the information given.\n\nGiven these points, the answer to the question is valid according to the article.\n\n**Output:**\n<answer>1</answer>", "q3_valid": 1, "q3_validation_response": "To validate the question and its answer, let's go through each segment and the given criteria.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - **Title:** The question title asks for the primary reason Monica's landlord gave for deciding to sell her rental flat in late 2024.\n   - **Background:** The background provides context that Monica is a tenant in the UK who has been notified that her rental property will be sold.\n   - **Resolution Criteria:** The resolution criteria specify that the answer should be based on Monica's account or the landlord's official notice and should be a short, specific phrase describing the reason.\n   - **Answer:** The provided answer is \"no longer viable.\"\n\n2. **Checking the Criteria:**\n   - **Tense and Details:** The question is about a past event (the landlord's decision to sell the flat), so it's appropriately framed in the past tense. The article is from an unspecified date but discusses events happening around late 2024, which aligns with the question's timeline (considering the question start date is 15th December 2024).\n   - **Definite Resolution of the Answer by the Article:** The article states, \"Her landlord has decided it is no longer viable to let the property and told Monica last month that he has decided to sell the three-bed flat.\" This directly provides the reason given by the landlord for selling the property. Thus, the answer can be derived from the article.\n   - **Well-defined Answer:** The answer \"no longer viable\" is short and directly taken from the article. It is not more than 3 words, so it meets this criterion.\n   - **Non-Numeric:** The answer is not numeric; it's a phrase, so it passes this criterion.\n   - **Single Correct Answer:** The article clearly states the landlord's reason for selling the property. While the phrase \"no longer viable\" is part of the reason, it is somewhat context-dependent. The full reason is \"it is no longer viable to let the property.\" However, the essence of the reason is captured by \"no longer viable,\" and there's no indication of multiple correct answers in the provided text.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Answer:**\n   - The article directly supports the answer \"no longer viable\" as it quotes Monica's account of her landlord's reason.\n   - The answer is concise and directly related to the reason given by the landlord.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question is well-framed and based on information present in the article.\n   - The answer \"no longer viable\" is derived from the article and meets the specified criteria for being short and non-numeric.\n   - The article provides a clear reason for the landlord's decision, supporting the notion that there's a single correct answer based on the information given.\n\nGiven these considerations, the response should be validated as correct because it adheres to the criteria specified.\n\n<answer>1</answer>", "individual_validation_done": 1, "choose_best_response": "To determine the best question based on the given criteria, let's analyze each question step by step.\n\n### Analysis of Question 1\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the new annual fee amount for Monica's son's private school after the January 2025 increase. The question start date is 15th December 2024, and the resolution date is 31st January 2025. Since the time horizon is more than a single day and is forward-looking, it is valid for forecasting.\n2. **Tense**: The question is not stated in the past tense; it's about a future event (the fee increase in January 2025).\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific numerical value (\u00a3X,XXX), implying a single correct answer. The resolution criteria specify that the answer must be the precise annual fee amount.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to Monica and her son, and potentially others in similar situations, but its broader impact might be limited.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a specific numerical value, not a binary or multiple-choice answer.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is clear and understandable, with sufficient details about the context and the required answer format.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The provided answer (\u00a34,032) is definite, well-defined, and in the correct format.\n\n### Analysis of Question 2\n\n1. **Valid for forecasting**: The question is about the primary reason Monica's landlord gave for deciding to sell her rental flat in late 2024. Given that the question start date is 15th December 2024, and the resolution date is 31st December 2024, the event (decision to sell) is already in the past relative to the start date, and the resolution date is before the start date or very close to it, making it not forward-looking from the perspective of the start date.\n2. **Tense**: The question implies that the decision and the reason have already been communicated, so it's about a past event relative to the question start date.\n3. **Single Correct Answer**: The question seeks a specific reason, implying a single correct answer, but the subjectivity of \"primary reason\" could allow for different interpretations.\n4. **Impact**: The outcome is relevant to Monica and potentially others in similar situations, but its broader impact might be limited.\n5. **Not Binary/Multiple Choice**: The question requires a short, specific phrase, not a binary or multiple-choice answer.\n6. **Understandable**: The question is understandable, but the context and details are somewhat limited.\n7. **Definite Answer**: The provided answer (\"no longer viable\") is somewhat vague and lacks context.\n\n### Comparison and Conclusion\n\n- **Question 1** meets all the criteria: it's forward-looking, not in the past tense, has a single correct answer, is not binary or multiple-choice, is understandable, and has a definite answer. It has a clear resolution criteria and is relevant to the individuals involved.\n- **Question 2** does not meet the criteria for being forward-looking and is about a past event relative to the question start date. It's also somewhat vague in its answer.\n\nGiven the analysis, **Question 1** is the best question as it satisfies all the given criteria.\n\n### Output\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the new annual fee amount for Monica's son's private school after the January 2025 increase?</question_title>\n<background>Question Start Date: 15th December 2024.
