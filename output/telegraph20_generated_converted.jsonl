A total of £82m has gone to just one law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills.\nAt the same time thousands of sub-postmasters are yet to receive the compensation they are owed and less than one third of the £1.8bn allocated has so far been paid out due to an arduous claims process, said Liam Byrne, chairman of the Committee.\nHe said: “Years on from the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, thousands of Post Office Horizon victims still don’t have the redress to which they’re entitled for the shatter and ruin of their lives.\n“Ours is a nation that believes in fair play and the rule of law. Yet victims told us that seeking the redress to which they are entitled is akin to a second trial. Payments are so slow that people are dying before they get justice.\n“But the lawyers are walking away with millions. This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong.”\nThe MPs on the Business and Trade Committee called for the Government to take over the handling of all compensation schemes instead of leaving some of them in the hands of the Post Office.\nThey also demanded a simpler and quicker system, criticising “the gold-plated legalistic process” used currently which places an enormous administrative burden on victims.\nThe committee said: “Swift action must be taken to deal with the thousands of claimants who still have not been given the redress that is owed to them. Sub-postmasters do not want Post Office Ltd to deal with redress and neither does Post Office Ltd itself.\n“Post Office Ltd should not be deciding on what financial redress is owed to victims of its own scandal. The Government must finish the job in hand and remove Post Office Ltd from the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.”\nThe committee also said hard deadlines should be imposed to pay claims, with extra compensation given to victims if these are missed.\nMr Byrne said: “The new Government has made important improvements. Payments are faster and the redress scheme is at last fully funded with more money.\n“But we can’t go on like this. Justice delayed is justice denied. So today, we’re setting out a practical, common-sense plan to reboot the redress system.\n“Victims should have upfront legal advice to help make sure they get what’s fair. We need hard deadlines for government lawyers to approve the claims with financial penalties for taking too long. Crucially, we need the Post Office, which caused this scandal in the first place, taken out of the picture.”\nThe Post Office said much of the legal bill was incurred in setting up the compensation schemes.\nA spokesman said: “Working alongside government, we are focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible. The Government’s introduction of fixed-sum options without the need for postmasters to submit formal claims has helped greatly in accelerating settlements.\n“Our spend with external law firms is kept under constant review with a significant portion having been spent on establishing the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and Overturned Convictions redress process, thus enabling us to pay redress to victims of the scandal.\n“Our Chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the Government and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter.”\nOther schemes are run by the Government. They are the group litigation scheme, which as of November had only fully paid out 47pc of claims, and the convictions redress scheme, which is still struggling to contact several dozen individuals whose convictions have been quashed.\nA government spokesman said: “Since entering government, we have worked tirelessly to speed up the process of providing the victims of the Horizon Scandal with full and fair redress including by launching the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme earlier this year.\n“We are settling claims at a faster rate than ever before with the amount of redress paid doubling since July, with almost £500m being paid to over 3,300 claimants as of the end of November. We will respond to the Committee’s report in due course.”\nHerbert Smith Freehills said it has “immense sympathy” for the victims.\nA spokesman said: “Herbert Smith Freehills’ work has been complex and wide-ranging, involving hundreds of our staff over several years.\n“We are confident that our fee levels are in line with norms for highly complex matters such as this.”", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 07:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:28:20+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

The majority are not (for now, at least).\nOn average, Britain’s private schools are raising fees by 13.7pc between the first and second school terms, when the policy takes effect.\nOur league table analyses the fees of over 1,200 fee-paying schools across Britain to see how those local to you have adapted to Labour’s tax raid and, crucially, how this affects value for money through exam results.\nIndependent schools come in all shapes and sizes, with fees ranging from less than £10,000 a year to in excess of £60,000 for boarders at the most expensive institutions.\nHowever, one thing clear is that Labour’s tax raid has vastly reduced the options for parents of more modest means.\nIn 2022-23, around 57pc of day fees were less than £20,000 a year. Had fees increased with inflation, this figure would be 47pc today.\nHowever, the VAT hike, confirmed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Budget, means that today just 25pc of schools are below that threshold.\nWith fees costing more, parents will rightly be conscious about whether a school produces results worthy of the extra investment – and just because a school is expensive, it doesn’t guarantee results.\nLast year, Cardiff Sixth Form College recorded the best results among fee-paying schools with over 95pc of exams being graded the top grades of A* or A at A-Level. However, with VAT forcing fees up to £30,000 a year for its day pupils, the school will be out of reach for many.\nTelegraph Money analysis shows that, once you compare the top results relative to fees, lesser-known schools produce similarly impressive results – but at a fraction of the cost.\nAt the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students is The Cathedral School in Wales, where fees are £15,000 a year cheaper, but around 87pc of pupils are given the top grades at A-Levels and 64pc in GCSEs.\nWithington Girls’ School in Manchester has around 90pc of GCSEs and 74pc of A-levels at A* or A, based on exams taken in 2023. But its fees are among the lowest in the country, at £17,892 a year, even after the VAT change.\nHowever, for many parents the value of independent schools goes beyond academic achievements.\nWhile stalwarts of the public school system, such as Eton, Winchester, Tonbridge and Radley, produce excellent results, albeit at a steep price, they argue their higher fees contribute to multi-million pound capital projects and extracurricular activities.\nA spokesman from the Independent Schools Council said: “Independent schools take a much wider view of education than just exam results. Boarding schools in particular offer a wide range of activities outside the classroom and subjects inside the classroom.”\nEton, for example, with fees of £52,749 a year, recently opened a £20m sports facility complete with an indoor pool, climbing wall, squash courts and fencing salle.\nOur league table also allows parents to find the fees most relevant to their child’s current age – a first for a private school league table.", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 07:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:28:39+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

The opposite is true outside London, where parents often have little choice in where to educate their children, and even less now fees will rise by roughly £2,000 a year.\nFew people would argue against spending more on state education, but the model the Government has chosen really is nonsensical, driven as it is by ideology, not economics, and the perverse effects of a manifesto promise not to raise income tax.\nIn a desperate bid to tease voters away from the Conservatives, Labour promised not to increase income tax – by far the biggest revenue raiser for the Treasury.\nIf it really wants to raise money from those with the “broadest shoulders” it would be far more logical to, for instance, introduce another tax band for the very highest earners. But of course that is now impossible without breaking a manifesto pledge.\nTaxing private school parents to fund state schools (which they are already funding through normal taxation) is completely bone-headed.\nYou could even argue that parents should be given tax breaks, perhaps by allowing school fees to be part of “salary sacrifice” schemes, given they are freeing up state-funded places. There is a similar argument to be made for people using private healthcare and alleviating strain on the NHS.\nTo rub further salt into the wound the Government claims that the VAT raid is “ending a tax break” for private schools. That’s clearly disingenuous given they don’t receive a penny of public money (unlike in countries including Denmark and Australia).\nWhat comes next? The logical Labour move is for a renewed attack on our 150-odd remaining grammar schools, perhaps the biggest engines of social mobility this country has ever produced.\nThat would truly be a disastrous move but, with this mob, there is no reason to think logic will stop them.", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:28:45+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

He was the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Britain’s largest terrorist atrocity.\nA total of 270 people were killed when the Boeing 747 Clipper Maid of the Seas broke apart at 31,000ft as it flew from Heathrow to New York on Dec 21 1988.\nThe total included 11 people in the Dumfries and Galloway town of Lockerbie when the plane fell on their homes.\nBut the papers disclosed that no formal discussion about the controversial decision to free him was held by the Scottish Cabinet, which included Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon, the deputy first minister at the time.\nOnly sparse mentions of Megrahi are made in the minutes, including an acknowledgement by Kenny MacAskill, then the justice secretary, of an application by the Libyan government under Muammar Gaddafi for Megrahi’s release.\nMegrahi was released on Aug 20 that year, hours after the announcement, and flown back to the Libyan capital Tripoli, where he received a hero’s welcome from a crowd waving Scottish flags.\nThe scenes enraged people on both sides of the Atlantic, and the decision was condemned by Barack Obama and David Cameron, respectively the US president and UK prime minister at the time.\nScottish Cabinet papers from June that year reported: “Mr MacAskill said that on behalf of Scottish ministers, he was considering the formal application made by the Libyan government on May 5 2009 for the transfer of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi under the terms of the prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libya.”\nIn a further meeting on Aug 18, two days before the public announcement of the decision to release the prisoner, the papers read: “Mr MacAskill said that he is expected to be in a position to make a statement in relation to the prisoner transfer application and the application for compassionate release in the near future.”\nBut it took three years for Megrahi to die of the cancer, which it was claimed in 2009 could kill him within months.\nSpeaking recently on the anniversary of the bombing, Mr MacAskill said: “We do have rules for compassionate release which exist in Scotland.\n“It is dealt with by medical experts, the report came in that he had a prognosis of three months. It was on that basis I released him.\n“He was no threat to Scotland, he was a sick man, he lived considerably longer than the prognosis but I think there is [sic] reasons for that.”\nIn May, Abu Agila Mas’ud, another Libyan, will go on trial at a federal court in Washington, accused of making the bomb. Mr MacAskill said he believed that Mas’ud would be convicted and that “he is the bomber”.\nMegrahi did not have the skills for the bombing, but that did not mean he was not involved in some capacity, Mr MacAskill said.\nThe papers were published ahead of the broadcast of Lockerbie: A Search for Truth, a new Sky TV series that will be broadcast on Thursday, starring Colin Firth as Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the atrocity.\nDr Swire has long believed that Megrahi was wrongfully convicted of the bombing and that Libya was not behind the plot.\nHe has also insisted that the bombmaker was not Mas’ud but a Jordanian “who was a double agent, or even a triple agent” feeding intelligence both to his own country and the CIA, while making explosives for a militant group active in Palestine.\nOther bereaved families have expressed concern that the series and the casting of Oscar-winner Firth will “elevate Swire’s story” and propagate “unproven conspiracy theories”.\nHowever, Dr Swire has urged them to watch the series before making up their minds about who was behind the attack, while Sky TV has said victims’ families were consulted and the series does not “present a conclusion” about who was culpable.\nMr MacAskill was approached for comment via the Alba Party, of which he is the acting leader following Mr Salmond’s death in October.", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 07:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:29:05+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

These 8 steps will make it happen", "article_description": "The human race is hard-wired to avoid change – so if you want to make a big move, it’s time to get intentional", "article_maintext": "For some of us, the impetus to make a big life change can come from adversity, a major life event or a lightbulb moment. For Sarah Burghard, it was Asda and the sight of Christmas crackers in October. “I just felt overwhelmed by the inevitable consumerism of the season ahead. The thought of another Christmas season watching TV, eating and drinking too much felt like the road to an uninspiring 2025. I wanted something different”. Within weeks Burghard had moved to Lombok in Indonesia, where she now lives the life of a digital nomad. “I’d fallen in love with the country on previous visits. And that day in Asda was the final straw – once I got the idea in my head to be there before Christmas, there was no looking back.”\nHow many times have you vowed to do something radical – especially at this time of year – only to quietly drop that fervent resolution a few weeks later? In fact, 92 per cent of us will not follow through on a New Year’s resolution. “We’re hard-wired to feel wariness around change,” says therapist and business psychologist Paula Gardner. “For our ancestors, moving to an unfamiliar part of the landscape would bring risks, vulnerability and uncertainty, whereas knowing your area and the people around gave you higher odds of survival.” Research shows that one in three of us would avoid change altogether if we could.\nYou have to fight that “Better the devil you know” urge if you want to bring about change in your own life: so take the following practical steps.\nMake an anti-bucket list\nIf you’re still not 100 per cent sure what shape your big life change should take, start by establishing what you categorically do not want. This gives you clarity and helps you nail your values so you can plan for the future, says Sid Madge, author and founder of the Meee Programme who has worked for some of the world’s largest companies – and in 2010 walked away from the corporate life in search of new meaning. “You may have got out of the habit of thinking about what you want, because of life’s responsibilities and the pressure to do the things you think you ‘should’ do,” he suggests.\nSo, ask yourself: “What do I really NOT want in my life any more?” Put all these things on your anti-bucket list. Work in an office full of stressy people? Mountaineering? Learn a language? Once you start eliminating the “no’s”, the whole process becomes much more fertile and creative.\nMaybe commuting is on your anti-bucket list. So, what’s the alternative? Working locally or working from home. The next step is to ask: “What skills do I possess to enable me to do that?” And now you’re on a roll with planning for change.\nVisualise your changed life\nPicturing yourself living differently can make it more likely to become reality. “If you want to work abroad, for example, visualise what your day would be like,” says Gardner. “Picture yourself taking classes to learn the language, booking the accommodation and settling down to work with your laptop at a table on a sunny balcony. If you do some mental rehearsing, you’re more likely to do it for real,” she adds. This is why coaches create mood boards. “Including visuals that represent the lifestyle you anticipate – the locations, the activities, the highlights – can serve as a constant visual reminder to help motivate you, build momentum and keep your eye on the bigger picture.”\nGetting the end in mind before you start is a surefire method for success, says strategic business consultant Emma Mills-Sheffield. Especially if your goal is to lose weight. “Wanting to be the mother of the bride in a particular dress gives you a deadline. But you need to be intrinsically motivated too – how will I feel if I lose weight/get fit? Is it feeling stronger, healthier, more confident, with more energy to run after the kids? If I can visualise that, I can then work backwards from it and think: ‘Right, so what will it take to get me there?’”\nDabble before deciding\nThe theory of Possible Selves suggests that there are multiple possibilities for us out there – you could write that novel, but equally, you could go for that promotion or go back to university part time. “We don’t choose because it’s frightening to commit, but what if you could just play with those ideas? Rather than setting a goal, you can experiment,” says Gardner.\nSo, if you fancy becoming an aromatherapist, do a short course in aromatherapy to see what it actually entails. Read up on the subject and talk to practitioners, even ask if you can shadow them for the day. You may find you love it or realise it’s not for you. “When people set themselves big goals and don’t achieve them there’s the danger of the shame attached to not following through. But experimenting means you aren’t fully committing, just trying it on for size,” says Gardner. Dabbling can give you certainty that a particular new life plan is right for you, meaning you can move forwards with confidence.\nDo a budget\nMills-Sheffield says the financial planning stage is crucial, whatever your goal may be. “If you’re planning on leaving an unhappy marriage, don’t just pack a bag and leave. Have you done a financial review, and do you know what you can afford to do? If you can’t leave just yet, is there something you can do to boost your finances, such as get a part-time job to build up some savings?”\nIf you’re planning on launching a business or becoming self-employed, skipping this step can be dangerous. Optimism and confidence may not cut it if you don’t do your research and do a proper business plan. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), around 45 per cent of new businesses fail during their first five years, with lack of financial planning being a major cause. For Burghard, her new lifestyle is infinitely more affordable than her old one. “Living in Lombok costs a tenth of the price of living in Bristol. My lifestyle is so much better than in the UK, but my rent is just £170 a month.”\nDo it incrementally\nMaking a radical change is of course risky, and not everyone is in a position to do so. But change can be incremental rather than total and immediate, says Madge. “People try to change too much, and then they give up. Resolutions are hard to sustain. But you can use incremental change to gradually make a bigger one.”\nFor Katherine and Skip Khangurra, 41 and 56, from Windsor, launching their business, Libra Fine Arts, has been done in a manageable way so they can still afford to pay the bills. “After years of working in high-pressured jobs as aircraft dispatchers and the stress of clinging onto our jobs during the Covid pandemic, the move to launching our own business while remaining part-time in our jobs has given us peace of mind – and embracing a better work-life balance has been such a joy,” says Katherine. “I didn’t like that feeling of someone else pulling the rug out from under my life when my job was on the line, so this gives me a sense of control while doing something I love.”\nBe methodical\nFor Sandy Lancaster, 56, from Chiswick, a big career change was a huge leap of faith. “I longed for a career that felt more aligned with my interests and passions. Retraining as a colour analyst and personal stylist, selling the family law firm and trusting in my ability to succeed independently has been one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions I’ve ever made.”\nLancaster’s career change was carefully thought through and planned. “The only way I could do it was methodically, first researching, then investing in training, then building my client base from scratch. I leveraged my corporate background to create my business plan and used the downtime during lockdowns to build my social media presence and network.”\nResearch needs to be thorough if you want a realistic view of what’s ahead. “At your research stage, do the ‘boring bits’”, says Mills-Sheffield. “So, if your plan is to move to the seaside, go and spend a few weeks there in the winter and do the boring day-to-day tasks instead of only going when it’s sunny and spending all day on the beach. Go when it’s rainy and you’ve got to do a big shop at the supermarket.”\nMake connections\nBurghard took some essential steps to help pave the way for her Indonesian adventure. “Joining a Facebook community group and posting for social and business connections, I met an estate agent who helped me find an apartment and a variety of really friendly expat and local women who gave me encouragement and information about working visas and areas to live.” These connections have been key to her move being a success.\nFor Katherine Khangurra, making vital connections was a game-changer. “At first, we made a lot of mistakes, but we soon learnt from talking to people at craft fairs and asking questions. We made friends and useful connections. After a year of doing trade shows, we’re now on sale in 30 shops in the UK.”\nFind social support\n“The naysayers who question how you’re going to earn your income if you quit your job think they’re speaking from a well-meaning place, but often they’re piling on the doubt because of not wanting things to change,” says Gardner.\nBusiness psychologist Jess Baker says that negative vibes make our self-doubt kick in. “All it takes is for someone to ask an awkward question that pinpoints something we’re not quite comfortable with about this life change, and we’re in a self-critical tailspin.” So find social support among people in a similar situation, with whom you can have a shared language and understanding.\n“I threw myself into networking groups – places where I could connect with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and learn from others who were also carving out their own paths,” says Lancaster. “These groups became my lifeline.” Whatever your goal, accountability really helps, so find someone to help keep you on track and share the highs and lows with. “We try and do too much by ourselves, but if we have a running buddy to help us achieve fitness goals, it’s incredibly motivating to have them to answer to, knowing we’ll be in trouble if we bail on them,” says Mills-Sheffield.\nMarina Gask is co-founder of Audreyonline.co.uk, the platform for entrepreneurial women", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:29:18+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

That is nearly 10 times higher than in 1998/1999.\nAnaemia caused by vitamin B12 or B9 (folate) deficiencies also led to 3,490 hospital admissions in 2023/24, up four-fold from the turn of the century.\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “It is very concerning that cases of nutrition-related anaemia serious enough to warrant hospital admission have seen such a substantial increase over the past 25 years.\n“The near 10-fold rise in admissions for patients with a diagnosis of iron deficiency and a four-fold increase in folate deficiencies – primarily caused by a lack of nutrition in the diet – is particularly troubling.\n“While treatable with supplements or dietary changes, it comes with the risk of complications – in children, iron deficiency can be detrimental to development and has been linked to poorer attainment at school.”\nSymptoms of iron deficiency include being very pale, irritability, fatigue, increased heart rate, sore or swollen tongue, and enlarged spleen. The condition can cause heart failure if left untreated.\nOverall the NHS prescribed 804,936 courses of treatment for iron deficiency anaemia, up from 721,650 the year before.\nThe figures show there were also 2,630 admissions for B vitamin deficiency (other than folate), up 15 per cent on the previous year and more than triple levels in 1998/1999.\nSymptoms of vitamin B deficiency can vary but include fatigue, muscle problems, breathlessness, headaches, pale skin, vision problems and heart palpitations.\nThe NHS issued more than 260,000 treatments for vitamin B deficiency in 2023/2024, an increase of 11 per cent.\nThe data further showed 486 courses of treatment involved people with vitamin C deficiency, up from 338 the previous year, while 773 involved a lack of calcium, up from 758.\nProf Hawthorne said the link between overall health and nutrition is “well established” and a “poor diet can increase a patient’s risk of developing certain health conditions, while also exacerbating existing conditions”.\nShe added: “We have seen fresh, healthier foods spike in price over the last few years, making a nutritious diet increasingly unaffordable for some, while ‘fast foods’ are cheap, are filling and easy to access, but are low in nutritious content.\n“GPs are on the front line of this public health crisis, caring for patients who are experiencing the health consequences of growing deprivation.\n“It is unacceptable that a developed nation like the UK should see an increase in the number of conditions that can be linked to poverty and poor nutrition and yet this is the reality.”\nA recent survey of Royal College of GPs members found that 74 per cent have seen an increase in the number of presentations linked to poverty over the past year.\nResponding to the figures, a government spokesman said: “Lord Darzi’s report laid bare the poor health of our nation, which is putting pressure on our NHS services.\n“Our 10-year health plan will shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention and will include action to ensure people have access to a healthy and balanced diet.\n“Through the Plan for Change, we will fix the foundations of the country to ensure everyone lives healthier lives for longer.”", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 06:47:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:29:24+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

His most successful gambit was in India, where a joint venture in 1981 with the state-backed Maruti company made Suzuki the first large-scale foreign investor in what had hitherto been a closed and somewhat backward domestic industry.\nMaruti Suzuki grew to be India’s largest auto maker, with a dominant share of the affordable small car and commercial vehicle sector, despite rising competition from Tata and others. By 2007, the Indian government having gradually sold its stake, the venture was a wholly-owned Suzuki subsidiary; in recent years, half of Suzuki’s global output of more than 3 million vehicles have been sold in India.\nMeanwhile, Osamu Suzuki bolstered his broader ambitions by securing alliances with General Motors in the US and Volkswagen of Germany, though both came to grief. GM acquired a stake in Suzuki which grew to 20 per cent but was sold off to raise cash as GM itself slid towards bankruptcy in 2009; Volkswagen came in as a replacement investor, but the relationship soured and was unwound in 2015.\nThe Suzuki company traced its origins to 1909, when Michio Suzuki, son of a cotton farmer, began manufacturing looms for the silk industry in the coastal town of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka province. As export demand for Japanese silk declined in the late 1930s, Suzuki began to develop a prototype small car – and in the postwar industrial recovery, the company turned to manufacturing the low-cost Suzulight model, powered by a 360cc two-stroke engine, and a range of motorcycles.\nMichio Suzuki was succeeded by his son-in-law and adopted son Shunzo, who in accordance with Japanese custom took the family surname to perpetuate the business. Likewise, Osamu Matsuda – born at Gero in Gifu prefecture on January 30 1930 – became Osamu Suzuki at the time of his arranged marriage to Shunzo’s daughter Shoko and his entry into the company in 1958.\nAfter graduating in law from Chuo University in Tokyo, Osamu had first worked in a bank and reportedly harboured political ambitions. But he dedicated himself to the auto business and rose to be its president from 1978 to 2000, when he moved up to chairman.\nSuzuki was an autocratic and plain-spoken corporate chief: ‘“If I were to listen to everybody, it would make things too slow,” he wrote in his memoir I’m a Small-Business Boss (2009). He was also famously frugal, cutting back on air-conditioning in his factories, shifting production capacity from Japan to lower-cost Thailand, and flying economy class himself.\nHis anointed successor was his own son-in-law, Hirotaka Ono, whom he publicly declared to be more able than his son Toshihiro. But Ono died of cancer aged 52 in 2007 and Osamu Suzuki took up the executive reins again the following year, when the company’s profits were suffering from the global recession.\nInvestors became increasingly concerned at the lack of a succession plan, however, after the octogenarian Osamu declared his intention to stay in post “until the day I die”. He finally handed over to Toshihiro in 2016, having led a public apology following a scandal over discrepancies in the company’s fuel and emissions testing.\nBut he continued as chairman until 2021 – declaring himself “full of life” having played 47 rounds of golf in the preceding year, and “easily accessible for advice” whenever needed. He is survived by his wife and their three children.\nOsamu Suzuki, born January 30 1930, died December 25 2024", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 06:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:29:30+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

But I think it’s a dream job, really, in terms of being able to do a portrait and sculpt, and do something in bronze.\n“To be able to do a commission which is such high profile … it’s such a fantastic privilege.”\nMs Marsh, from Sheffield, said the way a subject was portrayed was crucial.\nHer aim was to convey the King’s “thoughtful character”, recognising that he is a deep thinking and spiritual monarch.\n“I think for myself, my key sense is a thoughtfulness, that’s what I wanted to put into the portrait,” she said of her impression of the King. “So, a sense of thoughtful consideration in terms of expression, his thoughtful character.”\nSam Starsmore, from Norfolk, a student on the building crafts programme, was tasked with carving the lettering on the plinth.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, now the Princess of Wales, was invited by her father-in-law in recognition of their shared interest in the arts and creative industries.\nAs the royal trio toured the site, which offers courses in craft and art forms from fashion and textiles to thatching and blacksmithing, the King’s eye was immediately drawn to a snail shell sculpture created by students.\nThere, he met Ms Marsh, revealing that he was “fascinated” by the piece.\nThe King told her of the “importance of safeguarding traditional skills for future generations”.\nShe has since been hailed as a “fantastic example” of the course’s success.\nSustainable communities\nThe King’s Foundation was founded when Charles was Prince of Wales in 1990. Known until recently as the Prince’s Foundation, its aim was to promote sustainable communities through education, training, and regeneration of historic sites.\nWhen he stepped in to save Dumfries House for the nation in 2007, with a £45 million rescue package, it became the charity’s base, offering educational courses for almost 15,000 students a year, with a focus on traditional and heritage crafts.\nThe King spoke last year about the battle to maintain such “timeless skills”, noting: “They are all rather disappearing.”\nKristina Murrin, chief executive at the King’s Foundation, said: “To celebrate the King’s Foundation’s 35th anniversary in 2025, we felt it was fitting to install a permanent monument to His Majesty at our charity headquarters Dumfries House, to recognise his role as our royal founding president and his positive impact on the local community.\n“Most importantly this new installation will showcase the talents of our students and alumni.”\n‘Very proud’\nMs Murrin added: “We are very proud of our graduate Lily, who has gone on to a successful career as a stone carver and sculptor.\n“She is perfectly suited to take on the job of creating this permanent reminder of our 35th anniversary.\n“Equally to have Sam, a current student on our building craft programme, creating the plinth for such an important commission just shows the depth of talent in traditional skills in this country and how hopeful we should be for the future generation of master craftspeople.”", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 07:22:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 07:29:50+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

The same goes for the Government’s intended housebuilding boom, which if it happens at all will take some time to get going.\nIn the meantime, the economy has to contend with the damage done to confidence by the Government’s tax raid on business and its package of enhanced workers’ rights.\nThe increase in employers’ National Insurance doesn’t happen until April, but already firms are taking evasive action. Hiring is being slashed, investment plans are being shelved, and many companies will attempt to claw back the increase in costs through higher prices.\nThe international backdrop looks equally bad. The UK economy still tends to move in tandem with the other major economies of Europe, where the outlook is similarly grim.\nIf there is a recession, it will nevertheless largely be one of Labour’s own making, an astonishingly inept outcome for a Government that came to power promising the most pro-business Treasury in history and the fastest rate of growth in the G7.\nInstead, the economy is grinding to a halt, raising the prospect of further growth-stifling tax rises to ensure compliance with the Government’s fiscal rules. The Chancellor’s promise of no more tax rises already looks hollow.\nJust as worrying, inflation is likely to prove stickier than many anticipate, fuelled by higher public sector pay awards, the increased minimum wage, the increase in National Insurance and Trump’s threatened tariff war.\nThis may in turn frustrate the Bank of England’s plans to bring down interest rates, notwithstanding the weakened economic outlook. Higher for longer will continue to be the order of the day.\nThe US Federal Reserve may similarly struggle to cut rates this year, but for rather different reasons. From the threatened tariff war to tax cuts and the mass deportation of immigrants, many of Donald Trump’s policies are inflationary. Higher for longer US interest rates imply a stronger dollar, a weaker pound, and an even weaker euro, which will hit parity against the dollar as the European Central Bank slashes interest rates to support a struggling eurozone economy.\nDon’t make the mistake many commentators made in 2016, at the start of Trump’s first presidency, of assuming his policies doom America to economic catastrophe.\nTrump’s deregulatory agenda alone is sufficient to keep the US economy booming for a while yet. Markets are admittedly already frothy, and valuations look stretched across the board. Rampant growth in largely unregulated private credit is as clear a warning sign as they come of financial excess. And Trump’s promise to further deregulate crypto is an accident waiting to happen if ever there was one.\nWhat’s more, Trump has got no convincing plan for dealing with the deficit, so investors will eventually begin to question the risk free nature of US Treasuries.\nYet all these threats are still some distance off, and I doubt they’ll materialise this year.\nAt some stage markets will crash, but it needs a trigger, and it is for now hard to see what it might be. Most of the US indices will therefore end the year higher than their current values.\nWe have nonetheless almost certainly already seen “peak Musk”. It is hard to have a conversation these days without some mention of this ubiquitous entrepreneurial dynamo.\nI don’t see him falling out with Trump in some massive clash of egos, as many predict; he’s got too much riding on keeping the president sweet to risk such a confrontation.\nBut the hype around the world’s richest man is now so extreme that he can only really disappoint. Jealous of his success, his rivals in Silicon Valley and beyond are circling, desperate to undermine him.\nIt’s possible that Peter Mandelson, Britain’s new ambassador to Washington, may be able to negotiate a carve-out for the UK from Trump’s universal tariff plan, but it is very unlikely that this would result in a fully-fledged free trade agreement, even if Trump were to propose one.\nTo sign such a deal would be a death blow for a UK agricultural sector already seething with anger over Labour’s inheritance tax assault on family farms. Rightly or wrongly, Labour will continue to prioritise getting closer to Europe over increased economic ties with the US.\nBritain already enjoys a perfectly good trading relationship with the US, and it is not clear that the obligations of a deal largely dictated by American interests would much improve things.\nThis is a column about economics; geopolitics is not my field. Yet the two have become so intermingled in recent years that it is impossible to avoid some assessment of geopolitical events.\nTrump’s re-election on a Make America Great Again, anti-globalist approach to international affairs has obviously turned previous calculations on their head. Yet I wouldn’t bet on what must be the most widely stated prediction for 2025 – that he’ll successfully impose some sort of shabby peace deal on Russia and Ukraine.\nUnder this scenario, a war-weary and economically crippled Russia would settle for the land already acquired while Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky would, with the threat of US military aid being withdrawn, have no option but to accept.\nThis view has become such common currency that it is now widely seen as inevitable. There is, however, many a slip, and I see no reason why Putin would accept such an outcome.\nAs for the nation of Oceania in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four – which sustains its totalitarian regime via a state of permanent war with Eurasia or Eastasia – endless conflict in Ukraine has become part of Putin’s raison d’etre. For him, “war is peace” – a way of keeping himself in power.\nThere’s little sign of Russia’s imminent economic collapse, or of Putin being toppled, which though much predicted in the West is more a case of wishful thinking than an outcome solidly grounded in probability.\nSo on that depressing note, here’s wishing all who have got this far good health and a prosperous new year.", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 08:16:24+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

But how does it work – and do the benefits extend beyond weight loss?", "article_maintext": "If you’ve spent the past few weeks starting the day with a Quality Street at 7am and finishing off with a mince pie at midnight, you are probably desperate to give your body a rest and shift that festive flab.\nWhen it comes to cutting calories, the path of least resistance is often to skip a meal. For many, it’s breakfast which gets the heave-ho, especially on a time-restricted diet plan which limits the time you can eat to eight or 10 hours a day.\nBut the latest scientific research reveals eating later in the day could lead to weight gain. By ignoring our circadian rhythm – our internal clock which tells us when to eat and when to sleep – we’re storing up a host of health problems.\nChrono-fasting is a new wellness trend which aims to bring our eating habits back in line with our body clock. But how does it work?\nWhat is chrono-fasting?\nChrono-fasting is a time-restricted diet based on the principles of chrono-nutrition – which is “the study of how our circadian rhythm and nutrition interrelate,” says Rhian Stephenson, a nutritionist and the founder of supplement brand Artah.\nStephenson explains: “Our internal clock, like a master clock, maintains a daily rhythm. This influences essential processes such as hormone release, energy levels, sleep, hunger, repair and regeneration. Our body has distinct functions throughout the day whether it be digestion, problem-solving, physical activity or an ability to respond to stress.”\nThe aim is to eat in the “biological day” and let the body rest in the “biological night”. Instead of eating between, for example, 8am and 8pm, eat between an early time-restricted window, having breakfast between 7am and 8am and dinner by 4pm or 5pm. Front-load calories early in the day: eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper, and make sure each meal has a good balance of fibre, protein, fat and phytonutrients.\nA 2022 meta-analysis of studies found dieters who consumed a greater proportion of their calories in the morning lost more weight than those who had more calories at dinner, possibly because of better alignment with their circadian rhythm.\nBenefits of chrono-fasting\n1. It’s better for our metabolic health\nThe same meta-analysis found early eaters had lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, blood sugar and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, a 2020 meta-analysis of studies found insulin and blood sugar levels were higher after the same meal was eaten between 8pm and 4am, than between 7am and 4pm – while eating carbs in the evening is known to spike blood sugar levels compared to the morning. All of that means eating early in the day helps with weight loss as we’re less likely to reach for a sugary snack to give ourselves a boost.\n2. It’s better for recovery\nWe all know that sluggish feeling we get in the morning when we’ve gone to bed on a full stomach. Stephenson says: “When we sleep, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol and various other hormones allow time for extensive physical and emotional recovery; our muscles, organs and cells repair, our immune system is strengthened, and our cognitive function is restored.”\n3. It’s good for keeping us regular\nThe most common time to empty our bowels is after breakfast. Dr Emma Derbyshire, a public health nutritionist from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, says: “You are most likely to go to loo in the morning – waking up triggers gut motility. But if your body clock gets disrupted, it can lead to constipation.”\n4. It’s easier to keep the weight off\nOne 2011 study found that dieters who ate more in the morning continued to lose weight even after coming off their calorie-controlled diet, while those who ate more in the evening put weight back on.\nIs chrono-fasting better than intermittent fasting?\nTime-restricted diets are a type of intermittent fasting. But there are other methods of intermittent fasting such as the 5/2 approach where you eat around 500 calories each day for two days a week. The problem is consuming such a small amount of calories on two days of the week runs counter to the principles of chrono-nutrition – especially if you save that up for dinner.\nStephenson explains: “Chrono-fasting may be helpful for people suffering from chronic stress – especially perimenopausal females – because if you wake up and don’t eat until 12, you can exacerbate that stress.”\nPlus, we may actually alter our sleep times if we eat too late. A 2024 German study which compared early and late time-restricted eating found that eating later in the day altered the circadian body clock, causing a delay in sleep timing. Those on the earlier plan also felt hungrier in the morning.\nHow to follow a chrono-fast diet\nEating within a shorter window is known to lower the amount of calories consumed - plus, there’s no snacking in front of the television in the evening. The balance of food you eat is important: a breakfast of cornflakes isn’t going to cut it. “Every meal should be high-protein and high in fibre: you’re aiming to get 25g of protein and 20g of fibre into each meal, so you’re still well nourished,” says Stephenson.\nDr Derbyshire reiterates the importance of fibre in our daily diets: “None of us are eating enough fibre,” she says. “We all need to get at least 10g more a day.” She suggests oat-based breakfasts with yogurt to boost protein levels and seeds, and making sure you include white meat, fish, eggs or cheese at lunch, alongside fresh veg and salad and wholegrains.\nFor example, 250g of Greek yogurt for breakfast will give you around 25g of protein. Chicken offers 27g of protein per 100g and salmon 25g. Foods with 6g of fibre per 100g are called high-fibre foods and include lentils and wholegrain cereals.\nTips to help with chrono-fasting\nIf you’re a night owl, bring the eating window forward in the day, but consider starting at 10am and finishing at 6pm or at the latest by 7pm. But bear in mind 70 per cent of us are actually “bears” – neither a lark nor an owl. Plus, says Stephenson, while our chronotype is influenced by our genes, “our circadian rhythm is not, and you can train it – as we do when we fly to a different time zone”.\nDo it in January. The hours of daylight we currently have match the suggested window of eating perfectly: when it gets dark at 4pm your body will naturally start getting ready for bed. Stephenson says: “At this time of year people are willing to stop drinking alcohol, one of the biggest disruptors of sleep, circadian rhythm and the gut microbiome.”\nPreparation is key. Eating a good breakfast takes planning and Dr Derbyshire suggests, “Preparing some overnight oats before you go to sleep. Feeling time-poor in the morning is a reason people skip breakfast.”\nWhat to eat for lunch in the office\nIf you are working from home, then making a bigger lunch than usual shouldn’t be a problem. But if you’re in the office and usually eat lunch on the go, Dr Derbyshire suggests, “Either pack a lunch (a light sandwich made with wholemeal bread and packed with protein and salad would work well) or choose a shop-bought salad which has a balance of protein, fibre and a wholegrain like quinoa.”\nPlan your dinner. Having soup at 4pm or 5pm if you’re working in the office can be tricky but make it the night before and take it in a thermos rather than resort to a shop-bought soup. Dr Derbyshire adds: “Plus, it’s good if you are restricting calories in any way to take a multivitamin each day.”\nThe chrono-fast diet plan\nStephenson’s supplement brand Artah is launching its own post-Christmas diet reset diet that lasts for three weeks. Stephenson says: “It’s possible to lose half a stone following the chrono-fast. The absence of sugar, alcohol, and ultra processed food combined with a focus on fibre, protein, and phytonutrients should lead to weight loss. As long as you’re following the core foods and the meal-timing principles, you’ll get great results. ”\nWeeks one and three\nThe average daily calorie intake in weeks one and three is around 1,500-1,600kcal per day, with the option to increase portion size depending on your goals and activity level.\nWeek two\n“Calorie intake during the chrono-fast is between 1,000-1,200kcals. Calorie intake is front-loaded in the day with around 450-550kcal for breakfast and lunch, and then for it’s soup (180kcal) or a broth (50kcal) [depending which plan you’re on]. There’s a ‘circuit breaker’ mid-way through the week, where people can eat one of our suggested meals in the evening should they need it.”\nFAQs\nHow long does the chrono-fast last?\n“Follow the strict chronofast for seven days only – and make sure you rest and recover while you do so,” says Stephenson\nCan I drink alcohol on the chrono-fast?\nNo: alcohol disrupts sleep and wreaks havoc on our body clock, so ditch it for this diet.\nWhat if I can’t eat until later?\nIf you can’t do it perfectly, then just do what you can. If you can’t have the soup until 7pm, this is fine as the calories are negligible.\nCan I exercise while I’m doing the seven-day chrono-fast?\nGive a hard training schedule a swerve and focus on a week of yoga and breathwork, plus don’t train hard in the evening. Artah are running on demand and weekly live sessions of yoga as part of the plan.\nIs the chrono-fast a calorie-controlled diet?\nCalorie intake might be lower than your usual diet but Stephenson says, “It’s not about trying to eat five almonds and a few grapes. It’s about eating good quality meals and understanding how much the timing of what you eat can impact your health.”\nHow can I adapt it to everyday life once I’ve done the fast?\n“You can follow the principles of chrono-nutrition in your daily life. Aim for eating earlier and to finish eating by 7pm three or four days a week, or at weekends if that’s easier,” Stephenson says. “You don’t have to stick to it every day – we all have social lives!”\nRecipes\nProvided by Artah\nBreakfast\nSpiced Shakshuka", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 09:00:20+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}

With the help of Universal Credit, she is able to pay her £720 rent each month and send her son to one of the most affordable private schools in Britain where fees are £5,600 a year.\nEven with a bursary, which reduces the fees to £3,360, Monica has cut back on every expense imaginable to help give her son the best start in life. From January 1, her fees will rise to over £4,000 thanks to Labour’s education tax. She is hoping to keep her son at his school but doesn’t know where she’s going to find the money.\n“My life is embarrassingly simple,” she says. “ We don’t have a television so I don’t pay for a TV licence, Netflix or any of that. If we watch something, it’s on YouTube or we rent library DVDs.\n“The heating goes on twice a day to warm the flat to 18.5 degrees. It’s terribly cold at times, but we try to use the principle of heating the person rather than the space.\n“I don’t have a mobile phone contract. I use pay-as-you-go because it costs me £5.60 per month. I’ve had the same phone for the past eight years. It’s a pain because now it’s really slow and there are certain websites you cannot open any more. But that’s life.”\nThe most valuable things Monica owns are her 10-year-old computer which she worries she cannot afford to replace and their second-hand car which she uses in the summer holidays to go hiking with her children.\n“We don’t have any luxuries. We don’t go to the theatre or the cinema, I can’t afford it. I need to save all the money I have so my son can go to his school,” she says.\n‘State school wasn’t an option’\nYou might wonder why someone with such little means chooses to spend more than a third of her income on private education. For Monica, the answer comes immediately. The memories of her older daughter’s experience at state school are still raw.\nHer daughter, now aged 20, attended one of Aberdeen’s most successful state schools, an academy that was known for its impressive exam results. However, rather than thriving at the school, her daughter was singled out because of her financial background.\nMonica says: “Most of her classmates came from the totally opposite background with totally different values. They were very wealthy families where children got whatever they wanted.\n“There were lots of drugs and smoking involved and my daughter just did not feel included and the school did nothing at all.\n“There was huge peer pressure to have the right mobile phone. She would say ‘Why can’t I have this jacket or this bag that the others have?’ Why can’t I have these shoes’.\n“And I understand that feeling when you are that age. But I’m sorry, I didn’t want to spend £150 on a pair of trainers.\n“There was zero support at the school and she left with one qualification because Covid hit. Luckily her life has completely changed since. She’s had so many positive experiences and can see the world is not so bad as it was at that school.”\n‘20pc rise is a lot to me’\nWhile her daughter is now going to college and has turned her life around, Monica will do everything in her power to make sure her son does not have the same experience.\n“In mainstream schools they put you in a box. Everybody needs to be the same, to think the same. There is no encouragement for critical thinking,” she says.\n“But since the second my son started going to his school, he has loved it. I remember we went for a trial day two months before he started and when we left he said ‘Mum, can I go already tomorrow’.\n“It’s been a year and a half now since he joined and there has not been a single day where he’s said ‘Mum, I don’t want to go to school’. He is taught in a class of 10 and it’s a wonderful environment.”\nBut despite his success, Monica is stuck. The school told parents earlier this month it would have to raise its fees by 20pc meaning Monica now needs to find £4,032 to keep her son at his school.\n“The stress of potentially having to uproot my child from school where he is thriving is overwhelmingly sickening, and it’s putting his future, and our stability, at risk.”\nA £672 increase is relative for everyone. For Sir Keir Starmer, who earns almost 14 times more than Monica, it is roughly equivalent to one day’s wages. But for Monica, who has sacrificed every luxury in life, there is nothing more she can trim from her vigilant budgeting to make up the shortfall.\nLabour’s attack on lower-paid hard workers\nAnd while you might think a low-paid single mother is exactly the type of person Labour claims to represent, it’s the Government’s own policies that have made her predicament worse.\nHer landlord has decided it is no longer viable to let the property and told Monica last month that he has decided to sell the three-bed flat meaning she needs to find somewhere new to live.\nBut despite increased regulation and taxes forcing thousands of landlords out of the market, prices aren’t coming down. Similar properties are up to £600 more expensive to rent each month than what Monica currently pays and she says the chance of getting a deposit and then a mortgage “in the current circumstances” is impossible.\nThe obvious solution might be to work more hours – currently, Monica works 14 and a half hours each week. But the cost of childcare is now so expensive she has calculated that if she applied to work full time, she would be left with less money after paying for a childminder to drop off and pick up her son each day.\nFor Monica, the extra work simply doesn’t pay. It means she’s stuck in a choice between downsizing, although the two-bed flats she’s been looking at are between £850 and £900 and therefore still more than she’s currently paying, and applying for council housing, which she fears she won’t get.\nThe reality is, Monica isn’t an outlier. Her case as a private school parent is far more common than the Labour government wants to accept.\nAround 90,000 private school pupils come from below-median-income households and a further 116,000 from outside the top two deciles.\nIt is those families that Labour’s VAT raid will disproportionately affect. “I came to this country for a better life,” Monica says. “But it really isn’t much better any more.”", "article_publish_date": "2025-01-01 08:00:00", "article_modify_date": null, "article_download_date": "2025-01-01 09:00:27+00:00", "data_source": "news_generated", "news_source": "telegraph20_generated", "original_file": "telegraph20_generated.jsonl"}
