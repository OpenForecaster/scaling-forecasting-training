Her lawyer, Dario Bolognesi, said the period of community service could be made shorter by good behavior.\nDe Sousa was picked up on a European arrest warrant at Lisbon Airport in 2015, but Italy dropped its extradition request last March. Her seven-year sentence was reduced to three by a partial clemency and general amnesty.\nDe Sousa claims no wrongdoing in the kidnapping.\nShe is one of 26 Americans, mostly CIA agents, tried in absentia and convicted in the only trial anywhere in the world involving the CIA's extraordinary renditions program, a practice alleged to have led to torture. Full or partial clemency was issued in four cases, including De Sousa's.\nThe case involving the kidnapping in broad daylight from a Milan street of Muslim cleric, Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, was an embarrassment to U.S.-Italian relations. Despite repeated requests from prosecutors, no Italian government ever sought to extradite any of the Americans, even after convictions were confirmed by Italy's highest court.

Looking like a jury box, ballpark style, with proper lettering on a sign at the back of Section 104, just behind where he plays right field.\nJudge leads the majors with 15 home runs, most of them hit very far and very hard. Huge at 6-foot-7, he was humbled when the team approached him with the concept. After all, this is a tradition-laden franchise that doesn't often do things to single out players, even Bronx Bombers.\n\"I was shocked, you know. I was surprised,\" Judge said. \"I think it's going to be a pretty cool idea that the fans will like. It will be something the fans I really think will enjoy.\"\nUnlike the King's Court in Seattle for ace Felix Hernandez or the Mannywood area that once developed at Dodger Stadium for Manny Ramirez, people won't be able to buy tickets in The Judge's Chambers.\nInstead, a cross-section of fans will be chosen to sit there. At first, those wearing Judge jerseys and T-shirts inside the stadium likely will get picked, along with their families.\nThe plan is to branch out for community groups, charity organizations, Little Leagues, schools, hospitals and others to occupy the space.\nWho knows, maybe someday even a real judge will preside. In 2012, Bronx-born U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor sat with the Bleacher Creatures for their noted \"Roll Call\" before a game.\nThose selected for this section with get Styrofoam gavels \u2014 stamped with \"All Rise!\"\u2014 to tap against the bench, along with other mementoes to keep. The robes, those stay.\nZach Venezio and Sophie Topouzoglou had seats near the Royals' dugout. But they gladly moved into the newly created spot when presented the opportunity to sit 20 rows behind Judge.\n\"I was on board right away,\" Venezio said. \"This is awesome. I even wore my Aaron Judge shirt out here tonight. I love the way he plays.\"\nJudge acknowledged his cheering section when he took the field before the top of the first inning, and lobbed a ball in that direction after warming up.\n\"It's exciting, that's all I can really say,\" Judge said. \"All the off-the-field stuff, the promotions, they're great. But I've still got a job to do on the field. If I'm not doing my job on the field, all this other stuff wouldn't be happening.\"\nThe Yankees started to think about a section for Judge in spring training. His success on the diamond and his interaction with fans \u2014 he likes to play catch with kids in the stands \u2014 made this an easy decision for the club.\n\"Aaron's a unique and engaging player and The Judge's Chambers is a reflection of that,\" Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo said.\nAs Judge's production increased, so did his popularity.\nThe Yankees took to punctuating his home runs with the distinctive thump-thump from \"Law & Order.\" Earlier this month, a group of friends showed up in the right field seats wearing black robes and judicial wigs.\nLike the Wolf Pack that howled for pitcher Randy Wolf in Philly or Sheff's Chefs who wore their hats for Gary Sheffield in Atlanta or the Coneheads way back at Shea Stadium, the crowds drove this move.\n\"It was the fans' enthusiasm over the last few months that allowed us to act upon this idea,\" Zillo said.\nThe section was built last week while the Yankees were on the road.\nAnd if all goes well down the road, maybe Judge might sport a judicial robe himself.\n\"It'd have to be extra tall, I think,\" he said, smiling. \"They'd have to find an extra tall one.\"\n\"I might have to. One of these days, you might get me into one. We'll see,\" he said.\n___", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/1b0ba509e8f546579401a2a2e59e8980/All-Rise!-The-Judge's-Chambers,-in-session-at-Yankee-Stadium?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Sports?src=rss", "article_date_publish": "2017-05-22 23:35:34", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2017-05-23 00:22:31+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the seating capacity of The Judge's Chambers section at Yankee Stadium by June 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Judge's Chambers is a newly created fan section at Yankee Stadium dedicated to rookie slugger Aaron Judge.\",\n    \"options\": [\"10 fans\", \"18 fans\", \"25 fans\", \"30 fans\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Who will be the first group of fans selected to sit in The Judge's Chambers section at Yankee Stadium by June 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Judge's Chambers is a fan section at Yankee Stadium where selected fans can sit and cheer for Aaron Judge.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Local Little League teams\", \"Fans wearing Judge jerseys and T-shirts\", \"Community charity organizations\", \"Hospital staff and patients\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What item will fans in The Judge's Chambers receive to keep as a memento by June 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Fans selected to sit in The Judge's Chambers at Yankee Stadium will receive special items.\",\n    \"options\": [\"A signed baseball by Aaron Judge\", \"A replica judicial robe\", \"A Styrofoam gavel stamped with 'All Rise!'\", \"A Yankees cap with Judge's number\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which of the following will NOT be a criterion for selecting fans to sit in The Judge's Chambers section at Yankee Stadium by June 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Judge's Chambers is a special fan section at Yankee Stadium with specific selection criteria.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Wearing Judge jerseys or T-shirts\", \"Being part of a community group\", \"Purchasing premium tickets\", \"Being a family member of a selected fan\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the location of The Judge's Chambers section at Yankee Stadium by June 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Judge's Chambers is a designated fan section at Yankee Stadium.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Behind home plate\", \"In the left field bleachers\", \"In Section 104 behind right field\", \"Near the Yankees' dugout\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n\n<think>\n**Question 0 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: Directly answerable from the article (explicitly states 18 fans), clear resolution criteria (by June 2017), options are distinct and non-overlapping.\n- Cons: Slightly overspecific (exact number), but still within reasonable forecasting bounds.\n- Forecastability: High, as it\u2019s a concrete detail mentioned in the article.\n\n**Question 1 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: Answerable from the article (fans wearing Judge jerseys/T-shirts will be picked first), clear resolution criteria, options are distinct.\n- Cons: Slightly less interesting as it\u2019s a straightforward detail.\n- Forecastability: High, but less engaging than other questions.\n\n**Question 2 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: Answerable from the article (Styrofoam gavel is explicitly mentioned), clear resolution criteria, options are distinct.\n- Cons: One option (replica robe) is close to being correct but not explicitly mentioned as a keepable item.\n- Forecastability: High, as it\u2019s a unique detail from the article.\n\n**Question 3 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: Answerable from the article (tickets cannot be purchased), clear resolution criteria, options are distinct and cover plausible alternatives.\n- Cons: Slightly more abstract as it asks for what will NOT happen.\n- Forecastability: High, but the negative framing might make it slightly less intuitive.\n\n**Question 4 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: Answerable from the article (explicitly states Section 104 behind right field), clear resolution criteria, options are distinct and cover plausible locations.\n- Cons: Less engaging as it\u2019s a simple factual detail.\n- Forecastability: High, but less interesting than other questions.\n\n**Ranking Decision:**\n- Best questions are those that are highly forecastable, engaging, and directly answerable from the article.

And at all of Trump's five stops on his first overseas trip, his team has spent weeks trying to build daily downtime into his otherwise jam-packed schedule.\nIt's all part of a worldwide effort to accommodate America's homebody president on a voyage with increasingly raised stakes given the ballooning controversy involving his campaign's possible ties to Russia. For a former international businessman, Trump simply doesn't have an affinity for much international.\nEven before Trump's trip morphed from a quick jaunt to Europe into a nine-day behemoth, White House aides were on edge about how the president would take to grueling pressures of foreign travel: the time zone changes, the unfamiliar hotels, the local delicacies. Two officials said they feared that a difficult trip might even lead the president to hand off future traveling duties to Vice President Mike Pence.\nTrump's final itinerary hardly eases him into the delicate world of international diplomacy on foreign soil. After departing Friday on an overnight flight on Air Force One, Trump will hopscotch from Saudi Arabia to Israel to the Vatican. He'll close his trip with a pair of summits in Brussels and Sicily, often-staid affairs that require leaders to be locked in lengthy plenary sessions.\n\"The chance of something going wrong - you insult the hosts, you get sick, your boss gets sick, you miscommunicate with your hosts, you make a scheduling error, you need to change the schedule just hours before a meeting, the motorcade get stuck in traffic, or the plane is stranded due to bad weather - is extremely high,\" said Julianne Smith, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\"Personally, I think they should cut it back now before they regret it,\" she said of Trump's long jaunt.\nThe trip marks the first time since taking office that Trump has spent a night away from the White House at a property that doesn't bear his name. And it's not just the bragging rights Trump gets when he goes to his own properties: Staffers know his meal preferences and the exact temperature he likes a room set at. He's often surrounded by long-time friends and acquaintances who have memberships to the commander in chief-owned retreats.\nThe only overnight trip Trump took abroad as a candidate was to mark the opening of a new golf resort in Scotland. He led journalists on a roving tour of the course and said his property would benefit if Britain's currency tanked following its decision to leave the European Union. He also made a daytrip to Mexico.\nThe stakes will be far higher as President Trump makes his debut on the international stage. He's the first president since Jimmy Carter to not travel abroad during his first 100 days in office. And he'll depart under a cloud of controversy, much of it of his own making, including the White House's botched handling of FBI Director James Comey's firing.\nNearly all of Trump's senior White House officials are traveling with him. First lady Melania Trump will also be on the trip, headlining her own events on each stop.\nThe Slovenian-born Mrs. Trump is the more seasoned international traveler in the relationship. She lived and worked as a model in Paris and Milan before moving to New York, and speaks multiple languages.\nBefore the couple married, they flew to Slovenia so the New York real estate mogul could meet his bride-to-be's family. The day trip marked the only time Trump has set foot in his wife's home country.\n\"At least I can say that I went,\" Trump told The New York Times last year.\nForeign travel has never been high on Trump's list of priorities. During his first marriage, he usually stayed behind when wife Ivana took his children for visits to her home country, the former Czechoslovakia. He's made the occasional stops to meet business partners abroad, but most of his travel has been to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and other U.S. properties.\nTrump's hosts on his upcoming trip are well-aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy.\nIn Saudi Arabia, people with knowledge of the planning for Trump's trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu. All the meat will have been butchered in a Shariah-compliant halal manner as per Islamic custom.\nThe people with knowledge of the Saudis' planning insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the sensitive details.\n_\nAP writer Abdullah al-Shihri in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this report.\n_\nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC", "article_url":

General Assembly has approved a Palestinian-backed resolution blaming Israel for violence in Gaza after narrowly rejecting a U.S. demand to add an amendment condemning attacks on Israel by Gaza's Hamas rulers.\nThe votes reflected wide concern in the 193-member world body that the resolution sponsored by Arab and Islamic nations was one-sided and failed to even mention Hamas, which has fired over 100 rockets at Israel.\nThe U.S. amendment to condemn Hamas, which was voted on first, was approved by a vote of 62-58 with 42 abstentions.

The coup at", "article_maintext": "ISTANBUL (AP) \u2014 A year ago Saturday, a group of Turkish soldiers using tanks, warplanes and helicopters launched a plot to overthrow Turkey's president and government. The coup attempt failed, but the fallout continues a year later.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan swiftly blamed his one-time ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is in exile in the U.S. and denies the allegations that he was behind the coup. The two had a public falling out in 2013, when Gulen's organization was declared a terror organization and a clampdown began.\nOn the night the coup event unfolded, the events made little sense to those watching and the culprit was far from clear. People turned to the news to make sense of what was happening. Many lined up at stores and ATMs, unsure if the country would function the next day. Istanbul and Ankara residents took cover in their homes as they heard the unusual sound of sonic booms from fighter jets.\nHeeding a call from the president, thousands of people took to the streets to stand up to the coup plotters. Some 250 people were killed and 2,193 injured. At least 34 coup plotters also died.\nBased on reporting from that night, along with information from the state-run Anadolu news agency and the Turkish president's office, here is an account of how the July 15-16 coup unfolded (all times local):\nJuly 15\n10 p.m.\nA group of soldiers closes off two Istanbul bridges that connect the part of Turkey that's in Asia to the part that's in Europe, leading to a Friday night traffic jam and prompting social media speculation about a potential terror attack. Military jets are heard flying over the capital Ankara and shots are fired at army headquarters.\n11:05 p.m.\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim says in a live televised statement that a group within Turkey's military is attempting a coup.\nJuly 16\n12:13 a.m.\nSoldiers aligned with the coup attempt take over the state broadcaster TRT, where anchorwoman Tijen Karas is forced to read a statement announcing the military has seized power from a government \"that lost its legitimacy.\" The statement cites autocratic rule and increased terrorism. It imposes martial law and curfews.\n12:26 a.m.\nHolding a microphone to her smartphone, Hande Firat, an anchorwoman for private broadcaster CNN Turk, uses FaceTime to interview Erdogan live on air . He says a minority within the military has attempted a coup outside the chain of command. He says they were incited by Gulen's \"parallel state,\" a reference to an alleged infiltration of state institutions by the cleric's followers. Erdogan calls people to assemble in the country's squares and airports, then connects to other channels using FaceTime to repeat his call to resist the coup.\n12:30 a.m.\nPeople begin flowing into the streets across the country to oppose the coup attempt. The Directorate of Religious Affairs instructs mosques to recite a verse, usually read before Friday prayers, to alert and invite Muslims to the streets. Municipal buses and waste haulers barricade army barracks.\n1:01 a.m.\nFighter jets and helicopters hit Ankara police headquarters six times, followed by strikes on a police special operations unit and a branch of Turkey's satellite operator TURKSAT.\n2:32 a.m.\nF-16 fighter jets piloted by coup plotters bomb Turkey's parliament 11 times, forcing members of parliament who convened for an emergency session to seek shelter in the basement.\n3:20 a.m.\nPresident Erdogan lands in Istanbul hours after departing a summer resort in Marmaris where he narrowly escaped capture and possibly an assassination attempt. He is welcomed by thousands of supporters. Earlier, all airports had been closed to aviation traffic and Istanbul's main airport seized by soldiers and tanks.\n4 a.m.\nAn official investigation is launched and detention warrants issued against alleged coup plotters linked to Gulen's network, including members of the judiciary and the military. Suspensions from public service and detentions are already under way.\n4:42 a.m.\nA helicopter bombs the Marmaris hotel where Erdogan had been vacationing and nearly 30 soldiers and commando squads raid the hotel, killing two police officers. Erdogan had already left.\n6:30 a.m.\nMore than 130 soldiers who occupied the Bosporus Bridge, now called July 15 Martyrs' Bridge, surrender to police and civilians resisting the coup attempt. Thirty civilians were killed there.\n6:43 a.m.\nBombs are dropped around the Presidential Complex in Ankara by the coup plotters.\n8:32 a.m.\nChief of Staff Hulusi Akar arrives at the Prime Ministry after being rescued. Akar was taken hostage at the outset of the coup attempt.\n5 p.m.\nPrime Minister Yildirim speaks in an extraordinary parliamentary session, saying Turkish citizens defeated the coup attempt and protected democracy. All four political parties represented in parliament issue a joint statement against the coup.\n8:02 p.m.\nThe government declares the coup attempt \"decisively\" put down. Millions gather across the country for a \"democracy vigil\" that goes on every night for nearly a month.\nPostcript\nDays after the coup attempt, an emboldened Erdogan declares a state of emergency that remains in place to this day. It has allowed the government to rule by decrees, bypassing parliamentary checks and balances, to bring down Gulen's network and other terror groups. Critics have called it a \"civilian coup,\" institutionalizing a clampdown that was already underway.\nMore than 50,000 people, including a dozen opposition parliamentarians and around 160 journalists, have been arrested. Some 100,000 public employees have been fired for suspected links to terror, among them academics, teachers, police and military officers. Judicial and administrative paths for the jailed and purged to defend themselves have been severely curtailed.\nTo Erdogan's chagrin, the U.S. has not extradited Gulen and some NATO allies have granted asylum to alleged coup plotters. International criticism of the post-coup crackdown is rampant and Erdogan, more isolated than ever, has further polarized the country.", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/6cc9e69a1c5d4da1b6f509ce1152b0ed", "article_date_publish": "2017-07-14 11:21:15", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2017-07-16 21:50:16+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Who will President Erdogan blame for the coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016, as per official statements?\",\n    \"background\": \"Following a coup attempt, leaders often make official statements about who they believe was responsible.\",\n    \"options\": [\"The United States government\", \"Fethullah Gulen\", \"The Turkish military high command\", \"The Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the approximate number of people killed during the coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016, based on official reports?\",\n    \"background\": \"Coup attempts often result in casualties, and governments release official figures afterward.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Around 100\", \"Around 250\", \"Around 500\", \"Around 1000\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which of these locations will be bombed by coup plotters during the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, according to reports?\",\n    \"background\": \"During coup attempts, key government and military sites are often targeted.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Istanbul's Grand Bazaar\", \"Turkey's Parliament\", \"The Hagia Sophia Museum\", \"The Istanbul Stock Exchange\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What action will President Erdogan take in the days following the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, as per official announcements?\",\n    \"background\": \"Leaders often take decisive actions in the aftermath of a coup attempt.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Resign from office\", \"Declare a state of emergency\", \"Dissolve the parliament\", \"Flee the country\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which group will President Erdogan call upon to resist the coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016, as per his public statements?\",\n    \"background\": \"During crises, leaders often appeal to specific groups for support.\",\n    \"options\": [\"The Turkish military\", \"The general public\", \"International allies\", \"The judiciary\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n\n<think>\n**Question 0 Pros and Cons:**\n- Pros: The question is answerable from the article, with clear options and a definitive answer.

No arrests have been made and officials on Saturday urged people who might know something to contact them.\nMacy Bell, 21, of Baton Rouge, was at the club when the shooting broke out.

When the gunshots stopped briefly, she said, she darted to her own car and fled.\nAs she ran, two other people rushed past her, saying they had been shot. Videos shared on social media and since removed showed gunfire, shouting and chaos.\nOne video appeared to show a man in black shorts hitting another man over the head with a glass bottle.

{"article_title": "AP-NORC Poll: Trump not boosted by strong American economy", "article_description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Donald Trump. Americans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved...", "article_maintext": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Donald Trump.\nAmericans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved during this presidency, according to a new survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nNearly two-thirds describe as \u201cgood\u201d an economy that appears to have set a record for the longest expansion in U.S. history, with decade-long growth that began under Barack Obama. More people consider the economy to be good today than did at the start of the year.\nBut significantly fewer approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, even as it remains a relative strength compared with other issues. The survey indicates that most Americans do not believe they\u2019re personally benefiting from his trade policies. And only 17% said they received a tax cut, despite government and private sector figures showing that a clear majority of taxpayers owed less after the president\u2019s tax overhaul passed in 2017.\nThese doubts create a possible vulnerability as Trump highlights the economy\u2019s solid performance in his campaign for re-election in 2020. During two nights of debates last week, almost every Democratic presidential candidate found ways to criticize the president by decrying the wealth gap.\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was evidence of \u201ccorruption.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders railed against the concentration of wealth in the three richest Americans, while former Vice President Joe Biden said Trump thinks Wall Street, not the middle class, built America.\nChristel Bastida, 39, a neuroscience researcher, was active in Democratic politics last year during the Senate race in Texas and plans to run for Houston City Council.\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t feel more secure financially and I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of people who are middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of working-class people are not comfortable now. I know there were tax breaks that were supposed to be helpful to people, but it turns out they\u2019re helpful to billionaires and corporations and I\u2019m neither.\u201d\nNearly half of Americans, 47%, approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, but his overall approval rating \u2014 38% \u2014 is low compared with what past presidents have enjoyed in strong economic conditions. Only about 4 in 10 Americans approve of his handling of taxes and trade negotiations.\nThe public skepticism has persisted even as the president routinely congratulates himself on the economy, including the 3.6% unemployment rate and stock market gains.\nHe tweeted last week: \u201cThe Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me.\u201d\nThe 2017 tax overhaul was sold by the administration as a way to return more income to everyday Americans. But the poll shows nearly half say they think their taxes stayed the same or are unsure; 33% said they increased. This suggests the tax cuts may have been too modest to notice or were eaten up by daily expenses, or that people were disappointed with their refunds.\nThat feeling of being left behind has energized Democrats seeking to turn out the vote next year. The tax overhaul disproportionately favored corporations and the wealthy, allowing Democrats to say the tax cuts were fundamentally unfair.\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to say the amount they paid in taxes increased in the last year, 42% versus 25%, while more Republicans say their taxes decreased, 25% versus 10%.\nNor are tariffs popular.\nTrump has imposed a tax on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, part of an effort to force the world\u2019s second-largest economy to trade on more favorable terms with the United States. China retaliated with their own tariffs that hit the U.S. agricultural sector, causing the Trump administration to provide aid to farmers with lost profits.\nThe president has also threated tariffs on Mexico in order to get that country to reduce the border-crossings into the United States and has mused about hitting European autos with import taxes as well.\nA mere 15% of Americans said the tariffs will help them and their family.\nWith regards to the national economy, just 26% said the tariffs will help, a sharp decline from 40% who said that last August. About half said the tariffs will be harmful.\nRepublicans, in particular, are less optimistic: Half think Trump\u2019s tariffs will help the economy, down from 7 in 10 in August.\nRyan Brueggemann, 37, of New Berlin, Wisconsin, runs a dairy farm with his brother. He supports Trump but dislikes the tariffs, though he understands why the president has deployed them so frequently.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a great business practice to use them,\u201d Brueggemann said. \u201cBut it came down to the point where our country is being taken advantage of unfairly and that the only way other nations were going to listen to what we wanted to renegotiate and even get them to the table to think about it was to get their attention by putting some tariffs on products.\u201d\nPaul Miller, 81, a retired shoe factory foreman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, said he still intends to vote for Trump, since he hasn\u2019t seen anyone better yet in the Democratic field.\nLiving off his pension and Social Security, Miller said the tax cuts were basically irrelevant for him. And he doesn\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s claim that China is paying for the tariffs, rather than U.S. consumers and companies.\n\u201cI sort of have mixed feelings about the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t believe it when Trump says we won\u2019t have to pay them. We will.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Carrie Antlfinger in New Berlin, Wisconsin, and John L.

His latest numbers further cement him as a leading candidate and are sure to draw notice from rival campaigns, many of whom have struggled to raise money.\nThe $24.8 million sum tops the $18 million raised last quarter by Bernie Sanders, who led the Democratic field in fundraising during that period.\nMore importantly, Buttigieg is doing well enough in public opinion polls and has received contributions from more than 400,000 people, which secured his spot in the September debates.\nDemocratic National Committee requires participants to hit 2% in multiple polls and 130,000 individual donors.
