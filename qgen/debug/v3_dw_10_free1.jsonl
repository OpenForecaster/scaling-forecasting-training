{"article_title": "Latin America: When climate change ruins renewables", "article_description": "Climate change has been disrupting Latin American efforts to make its energy more renewable. Countries are now searching for new solutions and everything from nuclear power to green hydrogen is being debated.", "article_maintext": "In Ecuador and Cuba, power cuts for hours at a time, sometimes even days. In Brazil, energy bottlenecks. Although Latin America is seen as a global forerunner in renewable energies, the impact of climate change is starting to cause problems. Droughts lasting weeks mean less water flowing through rivers and water reservoirs that power hydroelectric plants. And the less water, the less electricity.\nNow countries in the region are beginning to squabble over distribution too.\nColombia has halted electricity exports to Ecuador, citing concerns for its own power supply. Colombia has also been suffering a severe drought.\nEven though the causes for the power problems are unique to each country, the consequences are the same: energy rationing and power blackouts. This is why many countries are now debating how best to stablize their energy supplies.\nNuclear energy up\nEl Salvador, for example, plans a return to nuclear energy. \"We want to have the first research reactor by 2030,\" Daniel Alvarez, head of the country's General Directorate of Energy, Hydrocarbons and Mines, announced at a forum organized by the Latin American Energy Organization in October.\nOther countries are also showing renewed interest in nuclear energy, with a new generation of small modular reactors seen as particularly promising. The general opinion is that nuclear energy is free of emissions and can therefore be classified as green.\nLithium hype\nLithium also belongs to the energy debate in Latin America. Lithium is an indispensable part of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and it is hoped that carbon-neutral EVs will one day replace fossil-fuel powered engines on the street. At least, that's the plan. But resistance is growing in many Latin American countries.\nAs droughts become more frequent, they are increasingly wary of an extraction process that requires large volumes of water. In Peru, a mining project high in the Andes is drawing criticism. There, the Macusani Yellowcake mining company, a subsidiary of the Canada-based American Lithium Corp., is looking to mine 9.5 million tons of lithium on the Quelccaya glacier in the Carabaya region.\nEnvironmental activist Vito Calderon has criticized the way the project affects the water supply for local communities. \"The freshwater from the region flows into the Inambari, Urubamba and Azangaro basins, which feed Lake Titicaca,\" he told Radio France Internationale. Calderon fears the freshwater could be contaminated or removed from the natural cycle.\nWhat about green hydrogen?\nThe initial excitement over what is known as green hydrogen has also become more muted. \"Worldwide doubts about the strategic industry for Chile's future\" Chilean online news outlet Emol wrote a few days ago, summing the general mood up. The high cost of investing in green hydrogen is also causing hesitation.\nInstead, Alex Godoy-Faundez, director of the sustainability research center at Chile's University of Desarrollo has called for more realism and for taking small, manageable steps.\n\"Timelines should outline short-term goals that ensure that investment projects are profitable and eco-friendly,\u201d Godoy-Faundez said.\nInvestment in Brazil\nHowever in Latin America's largest country, Brazil, enthusiasm over green hydrogen has continued unabated. There's almost nowhere in the world like Brazil's undeveloped northeast, where electricity and therefore green hydrogen can be produced from renewable sources so cheaply, the country's media enthuse. Brazil could become a new global energy hub, they suggest. Foreign investors have already done deals with Brazilian states like Ceara and Pernambuco.\n\"Unfortunately, German investors are not among them,\" Ansgar Pinkowski, founder of the Brazil-based agency Neue Wege (\"new paths\" in English), told DW. His business specializes in providing information on the green energy transition and contacts between Europe and Brazil.\n\"With the recently passed laws for sustainable hydrogen, the risks for investors have also become much lower and more calculable,\" he said. As a result he predicts that, \"we will see very strong economic growth in the region in the next few years, from which all sections of the population will hopefully benefit.\"\nThis article was originally published in German.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/latin-america-when-climate-change-ruins-renewables/a-70740024", "article_date_publish": "2024-11-08 19:25:06", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-11-08 20:29:08+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>By what year does El Salvador plan to have its first research nuclear reactor, as announced by Daniel Alvarez?</question_title>\n<background>El Salvador is considering nuclear energy as a solution to stabilize its energy supply amid climate change disruptions.</background>\n<answer>2030</answer>\n</q1>\n\n<q2>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>Which two Brazilian states have already secured deals with foreign investors for green hydrogen projects, as mentioned in the article?</question_title>\n<background>Brazil is exploring green hydrogen as a renewable energy source, with significant interest from foreign investors.</background>\n<answer>Ceara and Pernambuco</answer>\n</q2>\n\n<q3>\n<question_id>2</question_id>\n<question_title>How many tons of lithium does the Macusani Yellowcake mining company plan to extract from the Quelccaya glacier in Peru?</question_title>\n<background>Lithium mining in Latin America is facing resistance due to its high water usage, especially in drought-prone regions.</background>\n<answer>9.5 million</answer>\n</q3>"}

In 2023, Brazil recorded about 840 cases.\nOropouche is common in Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus was first detected in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955. But it has been detected in Europe.\nItaly reported its first-ever case of Oropouche in June 2024. It was also the first case ever to be detected in continental Europe.\nThe patient diagnosed in Italy had recently returned from a trip to the Caribbean, Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported, citing public health authorities.\nHow does Oropouche fever spread?\nOropouche virus disease is transmitted through the bites of infected midges and mosquitos. Although the disease has long been circulating in Central and South America and the Caribbean, some countries have seen a sharp rise in diagnosed cases this year.\nThe disease is spreading to other countries that have never detected cases of Oropouche fever before. On June 11, the WHO reported the first-ever outbreak in Cuba.\n\"This is the first detection of the disease [in Cuba], therefore, the population is likely highly susceptible and there is significant risk of additional cases being detected,\" the report noted.\nSymptoms similar to dengue\nOropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus, which is transmitted most often through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge.\nThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the disease \u2014 to date.\nSymptoms of the disease are similar to dengue and typically start between four and eight days after the bite.\nThe onset is sudden, and symptoms usually include fever, headaches, pain, chills, joint stiffness and sometimes nausea and vomiting.\nMost patients recover in about seven days. According to the WHO, severe cases are rare.\nThere is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment available for the disease.\nClimate may play a role in spread of Oropouche\nOropouche fever is an understudied illness, as the authors of a May 2023 paper published in the journal Infectious Diseases of Poverty noted. As a result, the disease's epidemic potential and areas of likely spread remain \"unexplored.\"\nAlthough most cases of Oropouche fever thus far have been linked to tropical climate conditions, the authors noted that the lack of available data makes it difficult to draw precise conclusions. For example, some outbreaks have occurred outside the tropical conditions typically associated with transmission events.\nAlthough much remains unclear about the virus and its spread, the authors also noted that vegetation loss and deforestation appear to be associated with outbreaks of the disease.\nEdited by: Patricia Szobar\nSources:\nOropouche virus disease \u2014 Cuba, World Health Organization, June 11, 2024 https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON521\nTransmission risk of Oropouche fever across the Americas, published by Romero-Alvarez D, Escobar LE, Auguste AJ, Del Valle SY, Manore CA in the journal Infectious Diseases of Poverty (May 2023) https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-023-01091-2\nMinist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade confirma dois \u00f3bitos por oropouche no pa\u00eds (Brazil, Ministry of Health, July 25, 2024) https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/canais-de-atendimento/sala-de-imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/2024/ministerio-da-saude-confirma-dois-obitos-por-oropouche-no-pais\nThis article was originally published June 25, 2024, and updated July 29, 2024, to reflect developments in Brazil, where at least two people died from Oropouche \u2014 a further death was being investigated for Oropouche fever at the time of publication; one other death had been ruled out.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/death-in-brazil-what-is-oropouche-fever/a-69466634?maca=en-rss_en_science-22531-xml-atom", "article_date_publish": "2024-06-25 12:44:52", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-07-29 11:43:37+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>How many cases of Oropouche fever had Brazil recorded by late July 2024?</question_title>\n<background>Oropouche fever is a mosquito-borne disease with symptoms similar to dengue.

{"article_title": "Germany: Far-right AfD stumbles ahead of EU election", "article_description": "The Alternative for Germany has seen turbulent weeks: Top candidates caused outrage by trivializing Nazi crimes and are being investigated for links to China and Russia.", "article_maintext": "The leaders of Germany's populist far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party are breathing a sigh of relief: Sunday's local elections in the eastern German state of Thuringia were no triumph, but no disaster either. With the EU election looming, it seems no international scandal or internal row can deter its core voters.\nThuringia is one of the party's major strongholds: Led by one of its most notorious figures, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the Thuringian AfD has established itself as the biggest party in the state, regularly polling at over 30% \u2014 well above the national figures of around 15-20%.\nBut Sunday's local council elections, seen as a barometer both for the European elections in June and the Thuringia state election in September, did not bring the \"blue wave\" (the party's color) that some expected. Even though the party was able to increase its vote share on 2019 by 8 percentage points, reaching just under 26%, it was not able to claim a single mayor's office. Nine AfD candidates will have to make do with competing in run-off votes in the coming weeks.\nA horror week for the AfD\nThrough it all, the AfD is often still polling nationally in second place after the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) \u2014 despite the almost daily reports of rows, racism, and allegations of treason and corruption.\nLast week was calamitous for the party: It found itself ejected from its European parliamentary group after its leading candidate Maximilian Krah suggested to an Italian newspaper that not all members of Nazi Germany's SS were criminals. Krah, one of the party's new stars thanks to his populist diatribes on TikTok, also stepped down from the campaign and from the party leadership committee. He was already in trouble after one of his staff was arrested for allegedly spying for China.\nThis came just days after Thuringian leader H\u00f6cke was fined over a \u20ac130,000 ($108,000) by a regional court for using a banned Nazi slogan. Other European allies have distanced themselves: In an interview with Europe 1 TV last week, Marine Le Pen, leader of the French right-wing populist Rassemblement National (RN) criticized the AfD as \"going from provocation to provocation\" and giving \"radical groups\" too much space.\nAfD leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla then admitted that there had been \"massive damage in the current election campaign, for which Krah had provided the pretext.\"\nLater last week, Weidel told supporters at a campaign event that it was now crucial for the AfD to emerge stronger from this crisis. \"Such days, such moments when things are not going so well, are always also an opportunity to learn lessons in order to continue to grow and professionalize ourselves further,\" she said.\nUnaffected by scandal\nBut as Thuringia showed, the damage from all this was limited. \"A lot of people still voted for the AfD,\" said Andr\u00e9 Brodocz, a political scientist at Erfurt University. \"The AfD manages to re-frame these scandals. From their voters' perspective, it is not the behavior of the AfD politicians that is scandalous, but that of those who make it public.\"\nSimilarly, it didn't seem to matter to Thuringians that the domestic intelligence agency there has since 2021 deemed the local AfD \"proven extreme right\" and a threat to Germany's \"free democratic basic order.\" Oliver Lembcke, political scientist at the Ruhr University Bochum, thinks this is partly down to the underlying sympathies of many AfD voters: \"They have some far-right wing voters who appreciate that the party itself has this right-wing extremist wing.\"\nOn top of that hardcore of far-right voters, the AfD also reaches a larger voting bloc who are dissatisfied with the main parties \u2014 or rather, they are beyond dissatisfied.\n\"Their skepticism has grown almost to the level of resentment,\" Lembcke told DW. \"Their disapproval is so deep and far-reaching that it doesn't just apply to the politicians and political parties, but also to the political system itself.\"\nThis sense of grievance seems to make the AfD effectively immune to scandal. When a prominent AfD politician is convicted of a crime, or accused of abetting a foreign spy, to the party's supporters, this is all just more evidence of the corruption in the system.\nAfD unaffected by chaos\nGiven all this, and with the European Parliament election looming, it seems clear that AfD can rely on a solid bloc of supporters who distrust the media wholesale. \"If the news writes about the scandals, they won't read it, and if they do read it, they will most likely think it's just plain wrong,\" as Lembcke put it.\nGiven this mindset, the fact that the European Parliament's right-wing Identity and Democracy group decided to ditch the AfD is unlikely to affect its performance in the upcoming election.\nIndeed, the AfD's polling in the EU election is more or less identical to the national election polling \u2014 15-20%.\n\"It's a party of Euroskeptics anyway,\" said Lembcke. \"I think for AfD voters it's just another chance to express their skepticism about the system of the EU. And for politicians like Krah, it's not about being effective in Europe, or about being part of the European democratic process.\"\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-afd-stumbles-ahead-of-eu-election/a-69213691", "article_date_publish": "2024-05-29 13:24:54", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-05-29 14:26:33+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the AfD's vote share in the 2024 EU parliamentary election, as per current polling?</question_title>\n<background>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is a far-right political party in Germany that has been polling nationally in second place despite recent scandals.</background>\n<answer>15-20%</answer>\n</q1>\n\n<q2>\n<question_id>1</question_id>\n<question_title>How many AfD candidates will compete in run-off votes for mayor's offices in Thuringia's local elections, as of May 2024?</question_title>\n<background>The AfD performed in Thuringia's local elections but did not secure any mayor's offices outright.</background>\n<answer>9</answer>\n</q2>\n\n<q3>\n<question_id>2</question_id>\n<question_title>Which AfD leader was fined for using a banned Nazi slogan in May 2024?</question_title>\n<background>The AfD has faced multiple scandals involving its leaders, including legal penalties for controversial statements.</background>\n<answer>Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke</answer>\n</q3>"}
{"article_title": "Is Israel using 'surrender or starve' strategy in Gaza?", "article_description": "Israel's latest offensive has raised concerns that the country is implementing a \"surrender or starve\" plan to force Hamas out of northern Gaza. Many residents there are being forcibly displaced.", "article_maintext": "The Israeli military's latest invasion of Jabaliya in northern Gaza could not be more catastrophic for residents, who have already endured the bombardments and hardship of the Israel-Hamas war, now in its second year.\n\"It's dangerous here. Nobody can move. It's risky and unsafe. They asked us to leave, but there was no time. All of a sudden, the area was surrounded and under fire,\" said Mohammed, who didn't want to give his last name, by phone.\nAlmost two weeks ago, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a new ground offensive in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza and ordered people to leave the area \u2014 once again. The IDF said intelligence showed efforts by Hamas, the militant group that runs the enclave, to reestablish itself and regroup in the area.\nPalestinians and the United Nations fear that the latest invasion is part of a wider implementation of a \"surrender or starve\" strategy by Israel to forcibly displace northern residents and seal off northern Gaza, plans Israel denies.\n\"The Israeli military appears to be cutting off North Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip,\" the UN Human Rights Office said in a statement.\nMohammed, 41, said his wife and three children were visiting relatives in neighboring Gaza City when tanks moved in and airstrikes intensified in Jabaliya. He asked them to stay put.\n\"My neighbors and I stay close to each other, trying to share what is left of food and water. I don't know how long it will last,\" he said.\nThe UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that 50,000 people were displaced from Jabaliya over the past two weeks, while others remain stranded in their homes because of heavy fighting around them. According to OCHA, about 84% of the territory is under \"evacuation order\" by the Israeli military.\nSituation in northern Gaza is 'terrifying'\nEarlier this month, the Israeli army published a map showing new evacuation orders in several areas of the Gaza Strip, including Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. Residents were urged to leave immediately using the Salah al-Din route, a main north-south road, for the designated \"humanitarian zone,\" an overcrowded area lacking basic services in southern Gaza that Israel has also targeted in the past.\nBut many are weary of being displaced and appear to be seeking shelter within northern Gaza amid increased bombardment and fighting. Aya Tawfik, a volunteer nurse, fled with her siblings and father from Jabaliya to nearby Sheikh Radwan, a neighborhood in northern Gaza City.\n\"We don't want to go south,\" Tawfik told DW via text message. \"The conditions are harsh. We don't want to live in a tent, and there is bombing and death there, as well.\"\nShe described the situation in Jabaliya as \"terrifying\" as the fighting has also moved closer to the area where her family is now.\n\"We are staying in a house close to the new evacuation area. We can hear the explosions, the sounds of tanks and drones above us. We don't know if we can stay here or not,\" Tawfik said, adding that people were constantly on the move in search of safety.\nAfraid of never being allowed back home\nGaza's emergency services say they can't move around areas of heavy fighting and have to leave calls for help unanswered.\n\"It's a great risk for the safety of paramedics and the civil defense to get close to these areas,\" said Fares Afana, head of the ambulance services in northern Gaza. \"There are big numbers of those injured, and there are martyrs (dead bodies) scattered around in the streets.\"\nThe OCHA estimates that at least 400,000 people remain in northern Gaza, including Gaza City, the territory's largest city. Those who have remained in northern Gaza despite repeated military orders over the past year to leave for the south have done so for a variety of reasons.\nSome are caring for elderly and sick relatives. Others simply refuse to be uprooted from their homes or feel unsafe going anywhere under the constant threat of airstrikes. Many families are separated and scattered throughout Gaza.\nBoth Mohammed and AYA Tawfik fear that they will never be allowed to return home to northern Gaza. The small territory is now divided by the Netzarim corridor, a new road controlled by the Israeli military that runs from east to west in central Gaza. Residents say the road has made it almost impossible to return to the north.\nGaza's Hamas-run Interior Ministry had instructed civilians to ignore the call to relocate to other areas in the north of the Strip and to avoid heading south. The Israeli military claimed in a statement on Monday that Hamas militants were actively preventing some people from leaving.\nWhat is Israel's 'surrender or starve' strategy?\nThe military's latest moves and evacuation orders have led to speculation among Palestinians, media and aid organizations that the Israeli government is gradually implementing a \"surrender or starve\" strategy, also known as the \"General's Plan,\" in northern Gaza.\nThe plan was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by retired Major General Giora Eiland, a former national security adviser. According to Israeli media reports, the Israeli Cabinet has recently discussed several options, but it remains unclear whether any have been adopted.\nThe strategy reportedly aims to force Hamas and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, to surrender by putting pressure on the remaining population in the north. Israel has long accused Hamas and other militant groups of hiding among the civilian population. Under the plan, civilians would be ordered to leave through evacuation corridors in southern Gaza and the northern part would be formally sealed off. Anyone who remained would be considered an enemy combatant, and all supplies would be blocked in a complete siege.\nFar-right calls for Israeli resettlement of Gaza\nThe Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz reported this week that senior defense officials have indicated that the political leadership is pushing for the annexation of parts of the Gaza Strip. This comes amid renewed calls by politicians and far-right ministers for the resettlement of Gaza.\nFar-right groups have announced a large gathering in the coming days to \"train\" for the resettlement of Gaza. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any plans to allow Israeli settlers into Gaza.\nWhile it is unclear whether the military has adopted any components of the plan in its current invasion, UnN officials have sounded the alarm.\n\"Since [October 1], Israeli authorities have increasingly cut off northern Gaza from essential supplies,\" Muhannad Hadi, humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said in a statement on Sunday. The statement added that the military operations have forced bakeries, medical points and shelters to close, while \"hospitals have seen an influx of trauma injuries.\"\nFor people such as Tawfik, surviving this latest Israeli incursion is all that matters. \"This invasion is harder than the last,\" Tawfik said. \"We have no more energy. We are completely exhausted. We are constantly fighting to stay alive and not to lose our minds.\"\nEdited by: Davis VanOpdorp", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/is-israel-using-a-surrender-or-starve-strategy-in-gaza/a-70499619", "article_date_publish": "2024-10-15 18:03:02", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-10-15 19:31:11+00:00", "generated_questions": "<q1>  \n<question_id>0</question_id>  \n<question_title>How many people does the UN estimate were displaced from Jabaliya over the past two weeks, as of October 2024?</question_title>  \n<background>The Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza has been a focal point of recent Israeli military operations, with residents facing bombardment and evacuation orders.</background>  \n<answer>50,000</answer>  \n</q1>  \n\n<q2>  \n<question_id>1</question_id>  \n<question_title>What percentage of Gaza's territory is under \"evacuation order\" by the Israeli military, according to OCHA as of October 2024?</question_title>  \n<background>The Israeli military has issued evacuation orders across Gaza, displacing many residents and restricting movement in conflict zones.</background>  \n<answer>84%</answer>  \n</q2>  \n\n<q3>  \n<question_id>2</question_id>  \n<question_title>Who proposed the \"surrender or starve\" strategy discussed by Israeli officials as of October 2024?</question_title>  \n<background>Israeli media reports suggest discussions around strategies to pressure Hamas in Gaza, including plans involving forced displacement and siege tactics.</background>  \n<answer>Giora Eiland</answer>  \n</q3>"}

Rusta has been labeled the \"sexy ref\" in various media headlines and received misogynist messages on the social media platform as a result.\n\"They should focus more on my professionalism than on other things,\" she told the AFP news agency. \"You have to fight hard to be accepted.

One of the pioneers was German official Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb. She became the first woman to referee a match in one of Europe's top five leagues when she took charge of a Bundesliga match in 2017. Speaking to DW at the time, she echoed Rusta's recent sentiments.\n\"At the end of the day, the performance is what matters,\" she said. \"And the person producing the best performance should be the person on the pitch, no matter what gender, what hair color, what religion. That's all that counts.\"\nSteinhaus-Webb retired from the job in 2020, with Stephanie Frappart now the leading female referee. She made history by becoming the first woman to referee at a men's World Cup in Qatar 2022and said, \"I have always promoted the idea that we should be notable by our achievements and not by our gender.\"\nRusta's decision, however, highlights the distance football has to go in its battle against sexism.
