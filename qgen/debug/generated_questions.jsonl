{"article_title": "Former CIA agent to do community service for cleric kidnap", "article_description": "MILAN (AP) \u2014 A former CIA agent will do community service near Rome to complete her three-year sentence for taking part in the kidnapping of a Muslim cleric in Milan 14 years ago,", "article_maintext": "MILAN (AP) \u2014 A former CIA agent will do community service near Rome to complete her three-year sentence for taking part in the kidnapping of a Muslim cleric in Milan 14 years ago, her lawyer said Monday.\nA Milan court approved the lawyer's request for Sabrina De Sousa to complete her sentence by teaching English twice a week to minors living in state care. Her lawyer, Dario Bolognesi, said the period of community service could be made shorter by good behavior.\nDe Sousa was picked up on a European arrest warrant at Lisbon Airport in 2015, but Italy dropped its extradition request last March. Her seven-year sentence was reduced to three by a partial clemency and general amnesty.\nDe Sousa claims no wrongdoing in the kidnapping.\nShe is one of 26 Americans, mostly CIA agents, tried in absentia and convicted in the only trial anywhere in the world involving the CIA's extraordinary renditions program, a practice alleged to have led to torture. Full or partial clemency was issued in four cases, including De Sousa's.\nThe case involving the kidnapping in broad daylight from a Milan street of Muslim cleric, Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, was an embarrassment to U.S.-Italian relations. Despite repeated requests from prosecutors, no Italian government ever sought to extradite any of the Americans, even after convictions were confirmed by Italy's highest court. De Sousa was only detained after she set foot in Europe.", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/80203fea44d8468daba3f2d480e1dd2e", "article_date_publish": "2017-11-06 20:51:45", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2017-11-06 21:59:13+00:00", "generated_questions": "tags, we evaluate each question against the guidelines and then rank them.\n\n Let's think about the evaluation:\n\n  For each question, we check:\n\n   - Is it in MCQ format? (4 options, not binary) -> yes for all.\n   - Answerable based on article: yes, because the answers are explicitly stated.\n   - Not about historical knowledge: yes, because the court decision and the details of the community service are set on the day of the article (so future relative to the forecaster's cutoff) and the community service is to come.\n   - Direct and Precise: we have included resolution criteria (by the end of November 2017, as reported by AP) and the questions are in future tense? Actually, the questions are in future tense for events that are decided at the time of the article (the approval) but will be reported. So they are future until reported.\n   - Resolution criteria: included.\n\n   Background: does not help? \n      For Q0: background says she must complete her sentence through community service. Doesn't reveal the activity.\n      For Q1: same.\n      For Q2: same.\n      For Q3: background says her lawyer stated it might be reduced. This is in the article? Actually, the article says: \"her lawyer said ... the period of community service could be made shorter by good behavior\". So the lawyer did state that it might be reduced. But the background does not say how, so it's okay.\n      For Q4: background says she has been assigned to community service, without specifying the group. So it's okay.\n\n   Options: \n      - Four distinct options: yes.\n      - No overlap: the options are mutually exclusive? \n          For Q0: teaching vs cleaning vs ... -> disjoint.\n          Q1: locations -> disjoint.\n          Q2: frequencies -> disjoint.\n          Q3: means -> disjoint.\n          Q4: groups -> disjoint.\n\n   However, note the article does not explicitly state that she is teaching English to minors? It says \"teaching English twice a week to minors living in state care\". So the activity is teaching English and the group is minors in state care. But we are asking separately. So the article does state each part.\n\n   Forecastability: \n      - The events are specific and will be resolved by the end of November 2017 (since the news is already out on Nov 6, it is resolved by then).\n      - The forecaster has no access to the article, so they must predict based on prior knowledge? But the guideline says the question must be answerable solely from the article. However, the forecaster doesn't have the article. The point is that the article contains the answer, and after the resolution date, we can look at the article (or the news) to resolve. The forecaster must use their knowledge about the world to predict.\n\n   But note the guideline: \"The correct answer should be specified as the index of the option in the options list\" and it must be based on the article. So the answer is in the article.\n\n   They are interesting? They are specific to the case and not general knowledge.\n\n   However, one issue: the court approval happened on Nov 6, so by the resolution date (end of November) it is known. So they are resolvable.\n\n   Ranking:\n\n   We need to rank from best to worst.\n\n   Considerations:\n\n     - How interesting is the question?\n     - How clear is the resolution?\n     - Does the background leak information?\n     - Are the options well-formed?\n\n   Let's check:\n\n     Q0: The activity is the central point. It's clear and the options are distinct.\n\n     Q1: The location is also clear. \n\n     Q2: The frequency is specific and clear.\n\n     Q3: The means of shortening the service is a bit less central, but still clear.\n\n     Q4: The group is a detail, but it's explicitly stated.\n\n     However, note that Q0 and Q4 are about the same assignment: the activity and the group. The article ties them together. But they are separate questions.\n\n     Potential issue: The article says \"teaching English twice a week to minors living in state care\". So if the forecaster predicts that she will teach English, they might also predict the group? But that's not a problem because the questions are separate.\n\n     But note: the background in Q4 does not mention teaching. So the forecaster for Q4 does not know that the activity is teaching. They might have to predict the group without knowing the activity? But the article specifies the group for the teaching activity. So the group is fixed regardless of the activity? Actually, the group is part of the assignment. So it's a valid question.\n\n     However, the background in Q4 says: \"assigned to community service\" without specifying the activity. Then the options are groups. The forecaster might not know that the community service has a target group? But in reality, community service can be for a general public or a specific group. So it's a fair question.\n\n     Now, let's compare:\n\n        Q0: Good.\n        Q1: Good.\n        Q2: Good.\n        Q3: The answer is \"good behavior\", which is explicitly stated. The other options (paying a fine, etc.) are not mentioned. So it's good.\n        Q4: Good.\n\n     But note: In Q3, the background says: \"Sabrina De Sousa's lawyer has stated that the period of community service might be reduced.\" This is taken from the article (the lawyer said ... could be made shorter). So it's acceptable.\n\n     However, we must avoid the background helping. For Q3, the background does not reveal the means, so it's okay.\n\n     All are good, but we can rank:\n\n        Best: Q0 because it's the main activity and the most central.\n\n        Then Q1: location is also important.\n\n        Then Q2: frequency is a detail.\n\n        Then Q4: the group is a detail, but it's explicitly stated.\n\n        Then Q3: the means of shortening is a conditional possibility (could be) and is a minor detail.\n\n     Alternatively, we can rank by how unambiguous the resolution is:\n\n        They are all unambiguous because the article states them.\n\n     But note: for Q3, the article says \"could be made shorter by good behavior\". It doesn't say that this is the only way, but it is the only way mentioned. And the other options are not mentioned. So it's clear.\n\n     I think Q0, Q1, Q2, Q4, Q3? Or maybe Q0, Q2, Q1, Q4, Q3? \n\n     Let me think:\n\n        Q0: teaching English -> major aspect.\n        Q1: near Rome -> important detail.\n        Q2: twice a week -> specific detail.\n        Q4: minors in state care -> specific detail of the assignment.\n        Q3: good behavior -> a condition for shortening.\n\n     So the ranking might be: Q0 (most central), then Q1, then Q2, then Q4, then Q3.\n\n     Alternatively, we can consider the uniqueness of the event:\n\n        The activity (teaching English) is unusual for a CIA agent? So it's interesting.\n\n        The location (near Rome) is also interesting because she was involved in a kidnapping in Milan.\n\n        The frequency is routine.\n\n        The group is specific.\n\n        The shortening condition is standard.\n\n     So:\n\n        Q0, Q1, Q4, Q2, Q3.\n\n     But let's do the evaluation in the ```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What activity will Sabrina De Sousa perform as community service near Rome, as approved by the Milan court and reported by Associated Press by December 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Sabrina De Sousa, a former CIA agent, was sentenced for her role in a kidnapping and must complete her sentence through community service.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Teaching English to minors\",\n        \"Cleaning public parks\",\n        \"Working in a soup kitchen\",\n        \"Assisting in a hospital\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 0\n}\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Where will Sabrina De Sousa serve her community sentence, according to the Milan court decision reported by Associated Press by December 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Sabrina De Sousa must complete her sentence through community service as ordered by the court.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Near Rome\",\n        \"In Milan\",\n        \"In Lisbon\",\n        \"In her home country\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 0\n}\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"How frequently must Sabrina De Sousa conduct community service sessions, based on the Milan court ruling reported by Associated Press by December 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Sabrina De Sousa's community service requirements were specified by the Milan court.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Once a week\",\n        \"Twice a week\",\n        \"Three times a week\",\n        \"Daily\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What factor could shorten Sabrina De Sousa's community service period, as stated by her lawyer and reported by Associated Press by December 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Sabrina De Sousa's lawyer indicated that the duration of her community service might be reduced under certain conditions.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Payment of a fine\",\n        \"Completion of extra hours\",\n        \"Good behavior\",\n        \"Community service supervisor recommendation\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"For which specific group will Sabrina De Sousa provide community service, according to the Milan court approval reported by Associated Press by December 2017?\",\n    \"background\": \"Sabrina De Sousa was assigned community service targeting a particular demographic group.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"University students\",\n        \"Adult immigrants\",\n        \"Minors living in state care\",\n        \"Elderly residents\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n\n<thinking>\n### Question 0 Evaluation\n- **Adherence to Guidelines**: \n  - Title is MCQ format with 4 options, future-tense, and includes resolution criteria (by December 2017 via AP).\n  - Answer (\"Teaching English to minors\") is explicitly stated in the article. Distractors are plausible and incorrect.\n  - Not historical; resolution occurs after publication date.\n  - Background provides context without revealing the answer.\n- **Forecastability**: Highly predictable post-resolution as the article explicitly states the activity. Interesting because the specific assignment is non-obvious without the article.\n- **Pros**: Clear resolution, precise, central to the article's news.\n- **Cons**: None significant.\n\n### Question 1 Evaluation\n- **Adherence to Guidelines**: \n  - Title uses MCQ format with resolution criteria (by December 2017 via AP).\n  - Answer (\"Near Rome\") is explicit in the article. Distractors are distinct and incorrect.\n  - Background is neutral and necessary.\n- **Forecastability**: Directly resolvable from the article. Engaging as the location is a key detail of the sentencing.\n- **Pros**: Simple and unambiguous.\n- **Cons**: Slightly less central to the main event than Q0.\n\n### Question 2 Evaluation\n- **Adherence to Guidelines**: \n  - Title includes resolution criteria and is future-tense.\n  - Answer (\"Twice a week\") is verbatim from the article. Options are non-overlapping.\n  - Background avoids hinting at frequency.\n- **Forecastability**: Easily resolvable post-publication. Less inherently interesting as it's a logistical detail.\n- **Pros**: Factually precise.\n- **Cons**: More mundane compared to other questions.\n\n### Question 3 Evaluation\n- **Adherence to Guidelines**: \n  - Title specifies resolution source and timeframe.\n  - Answer (\"Good behavior\") is explicitly stated. Distractors are unsupported by the article.\n  - Background mentions potential reduction without revealing the factor.\n- **Forecastability**: Resolvable but focuses on a conditional possibility (\"could be\") rather than a concrete event.\n- **Pros**: Tests comprehension of a nuanced detail.\n- **Cons**: Less definitive than other questions since it describes a possibility, not an outcome.\n\n### Question 4 Evaluation\n- **Adherence to Guidelines**: \n  - Title includes resolution criteria and is clear.\n  - Answer (\"Minors living in state care\") is explicit. Options are distinct.\n  - Background describes the assignment generically without hinting at the group.\n- **Forecastability**: Directly resolvable. Interesting as it reveals a specific beneficiary group.\n- **Pros**: Highlights a unique aspect of the sentencing.\n- **Cons**: Slightly narrower in scope than Q0-Q1.\n\n### Ranking Rationale\nRanked by **centrality to the article's primary event**, **clarity of resolution**, and **forecasting interest**:\n1. **Q0** (activity): Most fundamental aspect of the sentencing.\n2. **Q1** (location): Key logistical detail tied to the main event.\n3. **Q4** (target group): Specific demographic detail enhancing uniqueness.\n4. **Q2** (frequency): Operational detail but less distinctive.\n5. **Q3** (shortening factor): Conditional detail, least concrete.\n\nBest to worst: [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]\n</thinking>\n\n```python\n[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]\n```"}

The Judge's Chambers, in session at Yankee Stadium", "article_description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The verdict is in: Rookie slugger Aaron Judge is getting his own rooting section at Yankee Stadium.\nNow in session, The Judge's Chambers.", "article_maintext": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The verdict is in: Rookie slugger Aaron Judge is getting his own rooting section at Yankee Stadium.\nNow in session, The Judge's Chambers.\nFramed by faux wood paneling, covering three rows and fashioned to fit 18 fans wearing black judicial robes with the Yankees' logo on the front and his No. 99 on the back, this court opened on Monday night.\nNew York hosting Kansas City was first on the docket. Looking like a jury box, ballpark style, with proper lettering on a sign at the back of Section 104, just behind where he plays right field.\nJudge leads the majors with 15 home runs, most of them hit very far and very hard. Huge at 6-foot-7, he was humbled when the team approached him with the concept. After all, this is a tradition-laden franchise that doesn't often do things to single out players, even Bronx Bombers.\n\"I was shocked, you know. I was surprised,\" Judge said. \"I think it's going to be a pretty cool idea that the fans will like. It will be something the fans I really think will enjoy.\"\nUnlike the King's Court in Seattle for ace Felix Hernandez or the Mannywood area that once developed at Dodger Stadium for Manny Ramirez, people won't be able to buy tickets in The Judge's Chambers.\nInstead, a cross-section of fans will be chosen to sit there. At first, those wearing Judge jerseys and T-shirts inside the stadium likely will get picked, along with their families.\nThe plan is to branch out for community groups, charity organizations, Little Leagues, schools, hospitals and others to occupy the space.\nWho knows, maybe someday even a real judge will preside. In 2012, Bronx-born U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor sat with the Bleacher Creatures for their noted \"Roll Call\" before a game.\nThose selected for this section with get Styrofoam gavels \u2014 stamped with \"All Rise!\"\u2014 to tap against the bench, along with other mementoes to keep. The robes, those stay.\nZach Venezio and Sophie Topouzoglou had seats near the Royals' dugout.

I even wore my Aaron Judge shirt out here tonight. I love the way he plays.\"\nJudge acknowledged his cheering section when he took the field before the top of the first inning, and lobbed a ball in that direction after warming up.\n\"It's exciting, that's all I can really say,\" Judge said. \"All the off-the-field stuff, the promotions, they're great. But I've still got a job to do on the field. If I'm not doing my job on the field, all this other stuff wouldn't be happening.\"\nThe Yankees started to think about a section for Judge in spring training. His success on the diamond and his interaction with fans \u2014 he likes to play catch with kids in the stands \u2014 made this an easy decision for the club.\n\"Aaron's a unique and engaging player and The Judge's Chambers is a reflection of that,\" Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo said.\nAs Judge's production increased, so did his popularity.\nThe Yankees took to punctuating his home runs with the distinctive thump-thump from \"Law & Order.\" Earlier this month, a group of friends showed up in the right field seats wearing black robes and judicial wigs.\nLike the Wolf Pack that howled for pitcher Randy Wolf in Philly or Sheff's Chefs who wore their hats for Gary Sheffield in Atlanta or the Coneheads way back at Shea Stadium, the crowds drove this move.\n\"It was the fans' enthusiasm over the last few months that allowed us to act upon this idea,\" Zillo said.\nThe section was built last week while the Yankees were on the road.\nAnd if all goes well down the road, maybe Judge might sport a judicial robe himself.\n\"It'd have to be extra tall, I think,\" he said, smiling. \"They'd have to find an extra tall one.\"\n\"I might have to.

And at all of Trump's five stops on his first overseas trip, his team has spent weeks trying to build daily downtime into his otherwise jam-packed schedule.\nIt's all part of a worldwide effort to accommodate America's homebody president on a voyage with increasingly raised stakes given the ballooning controversy involving his campaign's possible ties to Russia. For a former international businessman, Trump simply doesn't have an affinity for much international.\nEven before Trump's trip morphed from a quick jaunt to Europe into a nine-day behemoth, White House aides were on edge about how the president would take to grueling pressures of foreign travel: the time zone changes, the unfamiliar hotels, the local delicacies. Two officials said they feared that a difficult trip might even lead the president to hand off future traveling duties to Vice President Mike Pence.\nTrump's final itinerary hardly eases him into the delicate world of international diplomacy on foreign soil. After departing Friday on an overnight flight on Air Force One, Trump will hopscotch from Saudi Arabia to Israel to the Vatican. He'll close his trip with a pair of summits in Brussels and Sicily, often-staid affairs that require leaders to be locked in lengthy plenary sessions.\n\"The chance of something going wrong - you insult the hosts, you get sick, your boss gets sick, you miscommunicate with your hosts, you make a scheduling error, you need to change the schedule just hours before a meeting, the motorcade get stuck in traffic, or the plane is stranded due to bad weather - is extremely high,\" said Julianne Smith, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\"Personally, I think they should cut it back now before they regret it,\" she said of Trump's long jaunt.\nThe trip marks the first time since taking office that Trump has spent a night away from the White House at a property that doesn't bear his name. And it's not just the bragging rights Trump gets when he goes to his own properties: Staffers know his meal preferences and the exact temperature he likes a room set at. He's often surrounded by long-time friends and acquaintances who have memberships to the commander in chief-owned retreats.\nThe only overnight trip Trump took abroad as a candidate was to mark the opening of a new golf resort in Scotland. He led journalists on a roving tour of the course and said his property would benefit if Britain's currency tanked following its decision to leave the European Union. He also made a daytrip to Mexico.\nThe stakes will be far higher as President Trump makes his debut on the international stage. He's the first president since Jimmy Carter to not travel abroad during his first 100 days in office. And he'll depart under a cloud of controversy, much of it of his own making, including the White House's botched handling of FBI Director James Comey's firing.\nNearly all of Trump's senior White House officials are traveling with him. First lady Melania Trump will also be on the trip, headlining her own events on each stop.\nThe Slovenian-born Mrs. Trump is the more seasoned international traveler in the relationship. She lived and worked as a model in Paris and Milan before moving to New York, and speaks multiple languages.\nBefore the couple married, they flew to Slovenia so the New York real estate mogul could meet his bride-to-be's family. The day trip marked the only time Trump has set foot in his wife's home country.\n\"At least I can say that I went,\" Trump told The New York Times last year.\nForeign travel has never been high on Trump's list of priorities. During his first marriage, he usually stayed behind when wife Ivana took his children for visits to her home country, the former Czechoslovakia. He's made the occasional stops to meet business partners abroad, but most of his travel has been to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and other U.S. properties.\nTrump's hosts on his upcoming trip are well-aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy.\nIn Saudi Arabia, people with knowledge of the planning for Trump's trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu. All the meat will have been butchered in a Shariah-compliant halal manner as per Islamic custom.\nThe people with knowledge of the Saudis' planning insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the sensitive details.\n_\nAP writer Abdullah al-Shihri in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this report.\n_\nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/5e7e20245bc744fc8a6e71745239f56a/Worldwide-effort-set-to-keep-Trump-happy-on-1st-trip-abroad", "article_date_publish": "2017-05-19 12:26:39", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2017-05-19 16:32:00+00:00", "generated_questions": "tags, we will analyze each question against the guidelines and forecastability, and then rank them from best to worst.\n\nFinally, we output the ranking as a Python list.\n\nLet's proceed.\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What meal option will be available for President Trump at the official dinner in Saudi Arabia?\",\n    \"background\": \"An official dinner is planned during President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Steak with ketchup only\",\n        \"Lamb and rice only\",\n        \"Both steak with ketchup and lamb with rice\",\n        \"Traditional Saudi dishes without American options\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What scheduling feature has been built into President Trump's foreign trip itinerary?\",\n    \"background\": \"President Trump's team has made preparations for his overseas travel.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Extra diplomatic meetings\",\n        \"Daily downtime\",\n        \"Extended sightseeing activities\",\n        \"Public rallies\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Who will accompany President Trump on his entire first foreign trip?\",\n    \"background\": \"President Trump will be traveling to multiple countries during his overseas visit.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Vice President Mike Pence\",\n        \"First Lady Melania Trump\",\n        \"FBI Director James Comey\",\n        \"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What presentation style do foreign delegations expect President Trump to prefer?\",\n    \"background\": \"International meetings are being planned for President Trump's visits.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Detailed written reports\",\n        \"Long technical briefings\",\n        \"Short presentations with visual aids\",\n        \"Open-ended discussions\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"How many days will President Trump's first overseas trip last?\",\n    \"background\": \"President Trump is embarking on his first foreign trip since taking office.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"5 days\",\n        \"7 days\",\n        \"9 days\",\n        \"12 days\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n\n<thinking>\nThe task is to generate forecasting questions based on the article.

The coup attempt failed, but the fallout continues a year later.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan swiftly blamed his one-time ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is in exile in the U.S. and denies the allegations that he was behind the coup. The two had a public falling out in 2013, when Gulen's organization was declared a terror organization and a clampdown began.\nOn the night the coup event unfolded, the events made little sense to those watching and the culprit was far from clear. People turned to the news to make sense of what was happening. Many lined up at stores and ATMs, unsure if the country would function the next day. Istanbul and Ankara residents took cover in their homes as they heard the unusual sound of sonic booms from fighter jets.\nHeeding a call from the president, thousands of people took to the streets to stand up to the coup plotters. Some 250 people were killed and 2,193 injured. At least 34 coup plotters also died.\nBased on reporting from that night, along with information from the state-run Anadolu news agency and the Turkish president's office, here is an account of how the July 15-16 coup unfolded (all times local):\nJuly 15\n10 p.m.\nA group of soldiers closes off two Istanbul bridges that connect the part of Turkey that's in Asia to the part that's in Europe, leading to a Friday night traffic jam and prompting social media speculation about a potential terror attack. Military jets are heard flying over the capital Ankara and shots are fired at army headquarters.\n11:05 p.m.\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim says in a live televised statement that a group within Turkey's military is attempting a coup.\nJuly 16\n12:13 a.m.\nSoldiers aligned with the coup attempt take over the state broadcaster TRT, where anchorwoman Tijen Karas is forced to read a statement announcing the military has seized power from a government \"that lost its legitimacy.\" The statement cites autocratic rule and increased terrorism. It imposes martial law and curfews.\n12:26 a.m.\nHolding a microphone to her smartphone, Hande Firat, an anchorwoman for private broadcaster CNN Turk, uses FaceTime to interview Erdogan live on air . He says a minority within the military has attempted a coup outside the chain of command. He says they were incited by Gulen's \"parallel state,\" a reference to an alleged infiltration of state institutions by the cleric's followers. Erdogan calls people to assemble in the country's squares and airports, then connects to other channels using FaceTime to repeat his call to resist the coup.\n12:30 a.m.\nPeople begin flowing into the streets across the country to oppose the coup attempt. The Directorate of Religious Affairs instructs mosques to recite a verse, usually read before Friday prayers, to alert and invite Muslims to the streets. Municipal buses and waste haulers barricade army barracks.\n1:01 a.m.\nFighter jets and helicopters hit Ankara police headquarters six times, followed by strikes on a police special operations unit and a branch of Turkey's satellite operator TURKSAT.\n2:32 a.m.\nF-16 fighter jets piloted by coup plotters bomb Turkey's parliament 11 times, forcing members of parliament who convened for an emergency session to seek shelter in the basement.\n3:20 a.m.\nPresident Erdogan lands in Istanbul hours after departing a summer resort in Marmaris where he narrowly escaped capture and possibly an assassination attempt. He is welcomed by thousands of supporters. Earlier, all airports had been closed to aviation traffic and Istanbul's main airport seized by soldiers and tanks.\n4 a.m.\nAn official investigation is launched and detention warrants issued against alleged coup plotters linked to Gulen's network, including members of the judiciary and the military. Suspensions from public service and detentions are already under way.\n4:42 a.m.\nA helicopter bombs the Marmaris hotel where Erdogan had been vacationing and nearly 30 soldiers and commando squads raid the hotel, killing two police officers. Erdogan had already left.\n6:30 a.m.\nMore than 130 soldiers who occupied the Bosporus Bridge, now called July 15 Martyrs' Bridge, surrender to police and civilians resisting the coup attempt. Thirty civilians were killed there.\n6:43 a.m.\nBombs are dropped around the Presidential Complex in Ankara by the coup plotters.\n8:32 a.m.\nChief of Staff Hulusi Akar arrives at the Prime Ministry after being rescued. Akar was taken hostage at the outset of the coup attempt.\n5 p.m.\nPrime Minister Yildirim speaks in an extraordinary parliamentary session, saying Turkish citizens defeated the coup attempt and protected democracy. All four political parties represented in parliament issue a joint statement against the coup.\n8:02 p.m.\nThe government declares the coup attempt \"decisively\" put down. Millions gather across the country for a \"democracy vigil\" that goes on every night for nearly a month.\nPostcript\nDays after the coup attempt, an emboldened Erdogan declares a state of emergency that remains in place to this day. It has allowed the government to rule by decrees, bypassing parliamentary checks and balances, to bring down Gulen's network and other terror groups. Critics have called it a \"civilian coup,\" institutionalizing a clampdown that was already underway.\nMore than 50,000 people, including a dozen opposition parliamentarians and around 160 journalists, have been arrested.

(AP) \u2014 Police continued Sunday to investigate a shooting at a Baton Rouge nightclub that left seven people injured, even as officials in Louisiana\u2019s capital city pledged to do more to fight gun violence after several high-profile shootings.\nLocal news outlets report gunfire strafed the inside and parking lot of the Stadium Ultralounge & Bar early Saturday, apparently after a fight in which video footage showed one man breaking a bottle over another man\u2019s head.\nAt least two people were seriously wounded at the Stadium Ultralounge & Bar, although not all injuries may stem from gunshots, authorities said. No arrests have been made and officials on Saturday urged people who might know something to contact them.\nMacy Bell, 21, of Baton Rouge, was at the club when the shooting broke out. She told The Advocate that the fighting began when someone smashed a bottle over another person\u2019s head. Bell remembers the shooting went on for \u201cabout five minutes.\u201d The gunfire continued outside.\n\u201cThey were shooting everywhere,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt was a whole war zone.\u201d\nBell said she ran to the parking lot when the gunshots started and dove under a car, where she found three other women screaming and crying. When the gunshots stopped briefly, she said, she darted to her own car and fled.\nAs she ran, two other people rushed past her, saying they had been shot. Videos shared on social media and since removed showed gunfire, shouting and chaos.\nOne video appeared to show a man in black shorts hitting another man over the head with a glass bottle. Then a different man in a blue shirt started shooting in the direction of the original attacker.\nOnce the shots rang out, bar patrons began yelling, \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d At least four gunshots could be heard on video.\nA third video appeared to show another more gunfire outside as bar patrons scrambled to flee.\nBaton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome urged residents to contact police with information and said city-parish officials would meet this week \u201cto discuss more ways that we can work to put an end to gun violence, the public health crisis that is devastating our community.\u201d\nOther shootings last week in Baton Rouge included a triple homicide and the unsolved slaying of an 18-year-old man whose body was dumped in a park.\nThe woman listed in state records as a registered agent for the nightclub, Debra Williams, hung up when The Advocate contacted her Saturday afternoon.\nA club promoter for the Stadium Ultralounge & Bar also did not respond to a request for comment, but posted a call on Twitter following the shootings to \u201cpray for the victims tonight\u201d and \u201cpray for our city.\u201d", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/c33417690c4b4ea2aab0f82c0e7c9816", "article_date_publish": "2019-07-01 03:54:52", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2019-07-01 05:17:27+00:00", "generated_questions": ""}

Americans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved...", "article_maintext": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Donald Trump.\nAmericans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved during this presidency, according to a new survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nNearly two-thirds describe as \u201cgood\u201d an economy that appears to have set a record for the longest expansion in U.S. history, with decade-long growth that began under Barack Obama. More people consider the economy to be good today than did at the start of the year.\nBut significantly fewer approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, even as it remains a relative strength compared with other issues. The survey indicates that most Americans do not believe they\u2019re personally benefiting from his trade policies. And only 17% said they received a tax cut, despite government and private sector figures showing that a clear majority of taxpayers owed less after the president\u2019s tax overhaul passed in 2017.\nThese doubts create a possible vulnerability as Trump highlights the economy\u2019s solid performance in his campaign for re-election in 2020. During two nights of debates last week, almost every Democratic presidential candidate found ways to criticize the president by decrying the wealth gap.\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was evidence of \u201ccorruption.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders railed against the concentration of wealth in the three richest Americans, while former Vice President Joe Biden said Trump thinks Wall Street, not the middle class, built America.\nChristel Bastida, 39, a neuroscience researcher, was active in Democratic politics last year during the Senate race in Texas and plans to run for Houston City Council.\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t feel more secure financially and I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of people who are middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of working-class people are not comfortable now. I know there were tax breaks that were supposed to be helpful to people, but it turns out they\u2019re helpful to billionaires and corporations and I\u2019m neither.\u201d\nNearly half of Americans, 47%, approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, but his overall approval rating \u2014 38% \u2014 is low compared with what past presidents have enjoyed in strong economic conditions. Only about 4 in 10 Americans approve of his handling of taxes and trade negotiations.\nThe public skepticism has persisted even as the president routinely congratulates himself on the economy, including the 3.6% unemployment rate and stock market gains.\nHe tweeted last week: \u201cThe Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me.\u201d\nThe 2017 tax overhaul was sold by the administration as a way to return more income to everyday Americans. But the poll shows nearly half say they think their taxes stayed the same or are unsure; 33% said they increased. This suggests the tax cuts may have been too modest to notice or were eaten up by daily expenses, or that people were disappointed with their refunds.\nThat feeling of being left behind has energized Democrats seeking to turn out the vote next year. The tax overhaul disproportionately favored corporations and the wealthy, allowing Democrats to say the tax cuts were fundamentally unfair.\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to say the amount they paid in taxes increased in the last year, 42% versus 25%, while more Republicans say their taxes decreased, 25% versus 10%.\nNor are tariffs popular.\nTrump has imposed a tax on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, part of an effort to force the world\u2019s second-largest economy to trade on more favorable terms with the United States. China retaliated with their own tariffs that hit the U.S. agricultural sector, causing the Trump administration to provide aid to farmers with lost profits.\nThe president has also threated tariffs on Mexico in order to get that country to reduce the border-crossings into the United States and has mused about hitting European autos with import taxes as well.\nA mere 15% of Americans said the tariffs will help them and their family.\nWith regards to the national economy, just 26% said the tariffs will help, a sharp decline from 40% who said that last August. About half said the tariffs will be harmful.\nRepublicans, in particular, are less optimistic: Half think Trump\u2019s tariffs will help the economy, down from 7 in 10 in August.\nRyan Brueggemann, 37, of New Berlin, Wisconsin, runs a dairy farm with his brother. He supports Trump but dislikes the tariffs, though he understands why the president has deployed them so frequently.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a great business practice to use them,\u201d Brueggemann said. \u201cBut it came down to the point where our country is being taken advantage of unfairly and that the only way other nations were going to listen to what we wanted to renegotiate and even get them to the table to think about it was to get their attention by putting some tariffs on products.\u201d\nPaul Miller, 81, a retired shoe factory foreman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, said he still intends to vote for Trump, since he hasn\u2019t seen anyone better yet in the Democratic field.\nLiving off his pension and Social Security, Miller said the tax cuts were basically irrelevant for him. And he doesn\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s claim that China is paying for the tariffs, rather than U.S. consumers and companies.\n\u201cI sort of have mixed feelings about the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t believe it when Trump says we won\u2019t have to pay them. We will.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Carrie Antlfinger in New Berlin, Wisconsin, and John L.

But we are using a range to avoid exactness. The guideline says: \"Instead it should be about what happened, or predicting ranges.\" So it's acceptable.\n\n   Forecastability: Without the article, the forecaster would have to predict the result of the poll. This is a standard polling question and the forecaster might have other polls as context, but the specific poll result is not known until the article.\n\n Question 1:\n   Pros:\n        - Directly from article: Democrats more likely to report tax increase.\n        - Not binary, has four options.\n        - Resolution: June 2019 AP-NORC poll.\n        - Options are distinct: only one is correct.\n        - Background necessary and doesn't give away the answer.\n   Cons: None obvious.\n\n   Forecastability: Interesting because without the article, the forecaster might not know the breakdown by party.\n\n Question 2:\n   Pros:\n        - Directly from the article: most Americans do not believe they benefit.\n        - Not binary.\n        - Resolution: the poll.\n        - Options clear.\n        - Background minimal.\n   Cons: None.\n\n   Forecastability: It's about public perception, which the forecaster might have an opinion on, but the specific poll result is the resolution.\n\n Question 3:\n   Similar to question 0 but for overall approval. The same pros and cons.\n\n Question 4:\n   Pros:\n        - The change is explicitly stated: from 40% to 26% (14 points) -> decreased by 10-15 points.\n        - Not binary.\n        - Resolution: the poll and comparison to August 2018.\n        - Options are ranges to avoid exact numbers.\n   Cons: \n        - The exact change is 14 points, but the option says \"10 to 15\", which is a range. It's acceptable.\n\n   Forecastability: Without the article, the forecaster might know that there has been a trade war, but the magnitude of change in public opinion is not known.\n\n Ranking: We need to rank from best to worst.\n\n Criteria: \n   - How well they follow the guidelines? \n   - How interesting and forecastable?\n\n We note:\n   - Questions 0 and 3 are similar and both are about approval ratings (economy and overall). They are straightforward and the ranges are clear.\n   - Question 1 is interesting because it reveals a partisan difference that might be counterintuitive (people might think Republicans would be more likely to report a tax cut, but the question is about tax increase, and Democrats are more likely to report an increase). \n   - Question 2 is clear and the article states the majority view explicitly.\n   - Question 4 involves a change over time, which adds a layer of complexity.\n\n How to rank:\n\n   Best: Question 1 because it is the most specific and reveals a non-obvious fact (partisan breakdown).\n   Then Question 2: it's about the majority view on a policy impact, which is central to the article.\n   Then Question 4: it's about change over time, which is interesting.\n   Then Question 0 and 3: they are similar and good, but perhaps less interesting because they are standard approval ratings.\n\n   But note: Question 0 is about the economy approval, which is the main subject of the article. Question 3 is overall approval. The article emphasizes the economy, so Question 0 might be more central.\n\n   So:\n\n   1. Question 1: partisan tax perception.\n   2. Question 2: trade policy benefit.\n   3. Question 0: economy approval.\n   4. Question 4: tariff belief change.\n   5. Question 3: overall approval.\n\n   Alternatively, we can put Question 0 above Question 2 because the article is about the economy. But let's see the article title: \"Trump not boosted by strong American economy\". So the economy approval is key.\n\n   Revised:\n\n   1. Question 0 (economy approval) - central to the article.\n   2. Question 1 (partisan tax) - also central because the article discusses tax perception.\n   3. Question 2 (trade policy benefit) - also discussed at length.\n   4. Question 4 (tariff belief change) - a specific aspect of trade policy.\n   5. Question 3 (overall approval) - also in the article but less central than the economy.\n\n   But note: the article starts with the economy not boosting Trump, so both economy approval and overall approval are important. However, the article gives more space to the tax and tariff details.\n\n   We'll rank:\n\n     1. Question 0: economy approval (central to the article's thesis)\n     2. Question 1: partisan tax perception (a key detail)\n     3. Question 2: trade policy benefit (another key detail)\n     4. Question 4: change in tariff belief (shows a trend)\n     5.

But the article's main point is that the strong economy isn't boosting Trump, so the economy approval is the primary indicator.\n\n   We'll stick with [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n\n   But note: the ranking is from best to worst.\n\n Let's write the thinking for each in the ```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"According to the June 2019 AP-NORC poll, what percentage range of Americans approve of President Trump's handling of the economy?\",\n    \"background\": \"The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted a poll in June 2019 to gauge public opinion on President Trump's handling of the economy.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"30-40%\",\n        \"40-50%\",\n        \"50-60%\",\n        \"60-70%\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"According to the June 2019 AP-NORC poll, which statement about self-reported tax changes in the past year is true when comparing Democrats and Republicans?\",\n    \"background\": \"The poll asked respondents whether their federal income taxes increased, decreased, or stayed the same in the last year.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"More Democrats than Republicans reported a tax increase.\",\n        \"More Republicans than Democrats reported a tax increase.\",\n        \"Similar percentages of Democrats and Republicans reported a tax increase.\",\n        \"A majority of both Democrats and Republicans reported a tax increase.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 0\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"According to the June 2019 AP-NORC poll, what is the majority view of Americans on whether Trump's trade policies have personally benefited them?\",\n    \"background\": \"The poll asked Americans about the personal impact of Trump's trade policies.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Most Americans believe they have benefited.\",\n        \"Most Americans believe they have not benefited.\",\n        \"Americans are evenly split on whether they have benefited.\",\n        \"A majority of Americans are unsure about whether they have benefited.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"According to the June 2019 AP-NORC poll, what percentage range of Americans approve of President Trump's overall job performance?\",\n    \"background\": \"The poll measured President Trump's overall job approval rating.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"30-40%\",\n        \"40-50%\",\n        \"50-60%\",\n        \"60-70%\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 0\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"According to the June 2019 AP-NORC poll, how did the percentage of Americans who believe tariffs will help the national economy change since August 2018?\",\n    \"background\": \"The poll asked about the perceived effect of tariffs on the national economy and compared it to a previous poll in August 2018.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Increased\",\n        \"Decreased by less than 10 percentage points\",\n        \"Decreased by 10 to 15 percentage points\",\n        \"Decreased by more than 15 percentage points\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n\n<thinking>\n**Question 0 Evaluation:**\n- **Pros**: \n  - Follows MCQ format with 4 distinct, non-overlapping options.\n  - Answer (40-50%) is explicitly stated in the article (47% approval).\n  - Resolution criteria are clear: June 2019 AP-NORC poll.\n  - Background provides necessary context without aiding the answer.\n  - Avoids binary and historical recall.\n- **Cons**: \n  - Uses percentage ranges (allowed per guidelines to avoid exact figures).\n- **Forecastability**: Interesting as the forecaster must predict poll results without prior knowledge, testing economic perception.\n\n**Question 1 Evaluation:**\n- **Pros**: \n  - Directly from article (42% Democrats vs. 25% Republicans reported tax increases).\n  - Options are mutually exclusive and cover possible comparisons.\n  - Clear resolution source and date.\n  - Background is neutral and necessary.\n- **Cons**: \n  - None apparent.\n- **Forecastability**: High interest due to partisan divide;

His haul amounts to a show of force at a critical early juncture in the race where fundraising figures, and the number of people giving to a campaign, aren\u2019t just indicators of viability but criteria for qualifying for the debate stage in September.\n\u201cPete has proved why he is a top-tier candidate for the nomination,\u201d campaign manager Mike Schmuhl wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cFrom town halls on MSNBC, CNN, and FOX News to last week\u2019s debate, he\u2019s shown the country what I\u2019ve known for a long time: Pete is the best person to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington.\u201d\nButtigieg, 37, surprised many people with a first-quarter haul of roughly $7 million that topped many of his better-known rivals and helped place him in the top tier of a crowded 2020 field that has drawn more than 20 contenders. His latest numbers further cement him as a leading candidate and are sure to draw notice from rival campaigns, many of whom have struggled to raise money.\nThe $24.8 million sum tops the $18 million raised last quarter by Bernie Sanders, who led the Democratic field in fundraising during that period.\nMore importantly, Buttigieg is doing well enough in public opinion polls and has received contributions from more than 400,000 people, which secured his spot in the September debates.\nDemocratic National Committee requires participants to hit 2% in multiple polls and 130,000 individual donors. Though many campaigns are worried, DNC Chairman Tom Perez has resisted pressure to relax the requirements.\nCurrently, the only other locks for the fall debates are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign says he has $22.6 million cash on hand and received money from donors from all 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, with an average contribution of about $47.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sara Burnett contributed from Chicago.", "article_url": "https://www.apnews.com/3c36eac256bd4b7eb59c2c687ae89fee", "article_date_publish": "2019-07-01 11:00:17", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2019-07-01 14:07:35+00:00", "generated_questions": "tags.\n\nFinally, we will rank them from best to worst.\n\nLet's do the JSON first.\n```json\n{\n  \"question_id\": \"0\",\n  \"question_title\": \"Which candidate will be the first to announce their second quarter fundraising numbers for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary by July 1, 2019, as reported by the Associated Press?\",\n  \"background\": \"Presidential campaigns typically announce their quarterly fundraising totals to the media.
