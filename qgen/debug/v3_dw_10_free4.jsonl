Experts say Moscow's reluctance stems from its desire to capture market share from US shale players.", "article_maintext": "Russia has sought more time before committing to a Saudi Arabia-led proposal to deepen oil production cuts to deal with the coronavirus in China that has led to a sharp fall in energy demand.\nMoscow said it needed more time to gauge the impact of the virus on oil markets after officials from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies led by Russia recommended a cut of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) or about 0.6% of global supply on Thursday after an extended emergency meeting in Vienna.\nThe technical panel could not agree on scheduling an emergency ministerial-level meeting this month, moving up a summit planned for March.\nRussia \u2014 the world's second-largest oil producer after the United States \u2014 has been cooperating with Saudi Arabia in recent years to manage global oil supplies by compensating for higher output from the US, where a shale boom has doubled oil production to 12 million bpd since 2012. In December, the coalition known as the OPEC+ agreed to cut output by 1.7 million bpd and Saudi Arabia said it would further cut 400,000 bpd if the countries adhered to their quotas.\nExperts say Moscow's reluctance to agree to deeper cuts stems from its desire to capture market share from US shale players, many of which have been struggling to stay afloat as oil prices remain low.\nRussia believes it is better off with lower oil prices for the moment as it will lead to a fall in US shale oil production, leaving more room for Russian oil after the virus attack, Bjarne Schieldrop, an analyst at Sweden's SEB Markets, told DW.\nDefending market share\nMoscow has been a reluctant signatory to the 2016 deal amid fears of losing market share to the US, which is not participating in output cuts. On the contrary, Russia has been pumping in oil at record levels in the past two years. It complied with OPEC+ targets only for three months last year and that too largely owing to a monthslong contamination crisis on its Druzhba pipeline.\nThe Kremlin's budget is more resilient to low oil prices than most major oil producers. Russia expects to meet its planned spending needs while balancing its budget, if oil prices remain around $50 a barrel.\n\"The feeling is that they are relatively more comfortable to allow outright prices to fall a little lower, and are reluctant to see their market share diminishing,\" Philip Jones-Lux, energy market analyst at JBC Energy, told DW.\nSaudi Arabia \u2014 the world's top oil exporter \u2014 is more vulnerable. The break-even oil price for Saudi Arabia has remained above $80 a barrel \u2014 well above the average oil prices \u2014 in the past few years, forcing the kingdom to resort to money from its foreign reserves.\nThat's why, in recent years, Saudi Arabia, unlike Russia, has been more preoccupied with propping up Brent crude prices than with shielding its market share. Riyadh's last attempt at boosting market share ended in a fiasco some years ago, leading to a collapse in oil prices to around $30 a barrel. US shale players then proved to be more resilient than the Saudis had expected.\nSaudi Arabia proposed additional output cuts of 800,000 to 1 million bpd to deal with the current crisis. Many oil analysts are skeptical on how effective further cuts would be in supporting the oil markets, which remain oversupplied despite past cuts.\n\"For once, it seems like factors outside of OPEC+ announcements (vaccine news vs further quarantine news or demand collapse forecasts) are just as important for markets as what OPEC+ announces,\" Jones-Lux said. \"In reality, OPEC+ will supply the crude that is demanded without pushing more into the market.\"\nChina demand collapses\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China \u2014 with the latter consuming 13 of every 100 barrels of oil the world produces and being the world's largest oil importer \u2014 is likely to test both Saudi Arabia and Russia, which along with other OPEC+ members account for 70% of the Asian country's supplies.\nChinese oil demand has plunged by about 3 million barrels a day or 20% of total consumption, Bloomberg reported, hurt by extended factory shutdowns and a fall in air travel and road transportation. Brent crude has fallen more than 19% over the past month to around $55 a barrel, its lowest level in a year, despite a reduction of up to 1 million bpd because of troubles in Libya.\nSchieldrop said major refineries in China were set to reduce processing of crude in February by between 10% and 40%. Reuters news agency reported that Sinopec, the nation's biggest refiner, would cut its processing by 600,000 bpd, or 12% of its capacity, this month.\nJones-Lux told DW that the impact of the coronavirus, which has caused over 600 deaths, is \"already proving severe, with crude having to be resold and find new homes quickly.\" He said it were mainly the crudes from West Africa and South America that were being sold.\n\"This makes sense, given the longer travel times and the fact that much of the commitments to take Middle Eastern crudes are term commitments, making them more difficult to get out of quickly,\" he said.\nSetback for US shale producers\nThe fall in oil prices is also a major blow to US oil producers, even though they account for just a fraction of Chinese oil imports.\nThe latest drop will further hurt their profits, already hit by low oil prices over the past year. US shale producers, many of which need oil prices to remain at $65 or higher to break even, have been forced to slash jobs and investments in exploration and production.\nForty-two oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy in North America last year, according to the Haynes and Boone law firm. That took the total count of bankruptcy filings by US producers to 208 since 2015, when oil prices crashed.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-oil-shock-tests-saudi-arabia-russia-coalition/a-52292320", "article_date_publish": "2020-03-02 00:00:00", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2020-02-07 15:29:33+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>Leakage found -- The example \"1.7\" in the accepted answer format matches the actual answer. \nReplacement -- The answer should be a numerical value in million barrels per day (e.g., \"2.5\") as stated in the official announcement.</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the total oil production cut (in million barrels per day) agreed upon by OPEC+ in March 2020 to address the coronavirus impact?</question_title>\n<background>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, collectively known as OPEC+, have been coordinating oil production cuts to stabilize global oil markets.

{"article_title": "Thailand: Saving a beach paradise from mass tourism", "article_description": "Thai authorities want to cap the number of tourists at Maya Bay to recue its stressed marine ecosystem. The iconic cove from \"The Beach\" had to be sealed off to the public after almost all its coral was destroyed.", "article_maintext": "It's easy to see why Maya Bay has captured the imaginations of travelers.\nSurrounded by towering limestone cliffs on an uninhabited island in Thailand's Phi Phi archipelago, the secluded cove with its white sand and turquoise water is the very picture of paradise.\n\"It's such a beautiful place. It's the closest you could get, if you were to envisage a bay closed off to everywhere in the world,\" said Andrew Hewett, who owns a dive center on the bigger neighboring island of Phi Phi Don.\nMaya Bay is just one of dozens of idyllic beaches in Thailand. But it has become world famous as the place where the 2000 film \"The Beach,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was shot.\nTourists flocked to the bay after the film's release \u2014 at the cost of the marine environment. At the height of its popularity, there were more than 5,000 people visiting a day. In mid-2018, the overcrowding got so bad that authorities shut the beach.\nMaya Bay's ecosystem under stress\nTourist traffic led to pollution from discarded trash and damaged coastal vegetation. But the main problem was the speedboats ferrying hordes of daytrippers into the bay and dropping their anchors onto the coral below.\nAccording to Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist from Thailand's Kasetsart University, at the time the bay was closed, there was only 8% of coral coverage left, compared to up to 70% some 30 years ago.\nHe's been studying the Maya Bay area for decades, and his was one of the loudest voices calling for the beach to be shut. Initially meant to last just a few months, the closure has been extended indefinitely to give the coral more time to recover.\nHope for Maya Bay's corals\nSince 2018, dive teams have planted 20,000 coral fragments in the bay to help rehabilitate the reef.\n\"It's growing very well,\" Thamrongnawasawat rold DW. \"So we think that Maya Bay will return to be one of the very good coral reefs in maybe 5 to 10 years.\"\nHe says they're hoping to boost coral coverage to 50% within a decade, and to 60% in 15 to 20 years. New species have also been spotted since the closure, including black tip reef sharks who have returned there to breed.\nWhat will change at Maya Bay?\nAuthorities are planning to eventually reopen the bay to tourists, possibly as early as later this year, but they haven't announced a date yet. What is certain, though, is that visiting Maya Bay in the future will be a different experience to the one it used to be.\nTo protect corals, boats bringing in tourists will only be able to dock at a new pier on the opposite side of the island, rather than coming ashore on the beach.\n\"The visitors will come in another way, so they will not touch Maya Bay anymore,\" Songtam Suksawang, the former director of Thailand's national parks department and now an adviser to it, told DW.\nThere will be a cap on the number of tourists at the beach, and on the amount of time they can stay. Visitors will not be allowed to stray from a newly built boardwalk, and they'll have to book online in advance. Park rangers will also use digital trunk radio and other monitoring systems to keep tabs on tour boats.\n\"If we can manage the behavior of the visitors\u2026 we can conserve nature,\" Suksawang said, adding that the measures were needed \"if we want to sustain Maya Bay in the long run for the next generation.\"\nCautionary tale\nMaya Bay is just one of many spectacular places in the Phi Phi Islands. And its story could serve as a warning for other sites about the consequences of unchecked mass tourism.\n\"The local reefs can only manage so many stress factors,\" said Hewett from the dive center, who is also a spokesperson for the Phi Phi Island Conservation and Preservation group. In the 27 years he's lived in the area, he says he's seen the number of tourists \u2014 and the speedboats bringing them \u2014 balloon. Without regulation, or some kind of quota system for the islands, he's worried other pristine spots could suffer the same fate as Maya Bay.\n\"I think we do need to be looking at something which controls and manages the amount of people that come ... if we're going to allow the reefs to recuperate at a normal speed.\"\nBut he acknowledges that \"there are a lot of people that will be very disappointed about doing that because their businesses thrive on mass tourism.\"\nThe overtourism dilemma\nThe number of foreign visitors traveling to Thailand has grown rapidly in the past two decades. In 2000, the country received 9.5 million international arrivals. By 2019, there were nearly 40 million. The largest share of foreign tourists comes from China \u2014 where the number of people able to afford travel is only expected to increase as incomes rise \u2014 followed by Malaysia, then India, Korea, Laos, Japan and Russia, according to 2019 data.\nFor popular destinations like the Phi Phi Islands, allowing the tourist-dependent economy to thrive while protecting the natural beauty that attracts visitors in the first place can be a difficult balance to strike.\n\"We have to take care of nature, but we have to work with tourists in the long-term. [Fewer people] will mean less money, but we will have a future,\" said Phumipat Phutthipanjapong of the Phi Phi Island Tourist Business Association.\nThe stakeholder group was set up several years ago amid growing tourism to the islands. They organize regular beach cleanups to limit trash, monitor boat activity on the reefs and are working to boost recycling in hotels and restaurants.\nBut beyond sustainability issues, many Phi Phi businesses are now more immediately concerned with the battle to survive the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\nA more sustainable path for tourism?\nAccording to Stefan G\u00f6ssling, a professor of sustainable tourism at Sweden's Lund University, the pandemic could actually be an opportunity for the global tourism sector to set a more sustainable course. Popular destinations, in particular, he says, could ward off the problems that come with mass tourism by embracing business models that focus on quality rather than quantity.\n\"We know that you can attract specific types of tourists who might stay longer, who spend more, who are more interested in participating in local activities,\" he said.\n\"All of a sudden you realize that probably with a few tourists, you will be able to do much more to have a much greater economic impact locally than with many, many more tourists in another scenario.\"\nThe changes at Maya Bay are part of an effort to make tourism more sustainable in the long term, and it will likely take some time for visitor numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels. But Hewett describes it as \"wishful thinking\" to expect local companies to put sustainability ahead of their own survival.\nThe pandemic has been \"positive for the health of marine life\", he said. \"On the other side, there's business and people are in a hurry to try and make money.\"", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-saving-a-beach-paradise-from-mass-tourism/a-57230396?maca=en-rss_en_environment-22607-xml-atom", "article_date_publish": null, "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2021-04-23 08:06:38+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>By what year does Thailand aim to increase coral coverage in Maya Bay to 50%?</question_title>\n<background>Maya Bay, a popular tourist destination in Thailand, was closed in 2018 due to environmental damage caused by mass tourism.

If the EU's intentions are perceived as illegitimate, policies may be met with skepticism, seen as regulatory imperialism or disguised protectionism,\" said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade.\n\"Active engagement with the countries through, for example, their embassies in Brussels is key,\" Lange told DW. \"I have started such a process and already learned a lot. Understanding specific concerns is essential for finding solutions.\"\nCould Thailand join dispute?\nThailand is the world's third-largest producer of palm oil, after Indonesia and Malaysia. It is also a significant exporter of other products, such as timber, cocoa and rubber, that EU regulations will impact.\nThe country is also the world's biggest rubber producer, and exports of these goods to the EU were worth \u20ac1.5 billion last year, according to government data. Malaysia currently sells around 17% of its rubber products to the EU. Vietnam is another major rubber exporter focused on the European bloc.\nAccording to Thai government estimates, small-scale palm oil accounts for 70% of the country's production. But EU officials contend that the deforestation regulation targets large-scale illegal deforestation, not smallholders.\nBridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia, reckons the chances are \"reasonably good\" that Thailand will join Indonesia and Malaysia's campaign as they \"are concerned with the issue and leaning away from the EU in their foreign policy.\"\nHowever, a Thai government official, who requested anonymity because they were not permitted to talk about the issue, told DW it was improbable that Bangkok would join Malaysia and Indonesia in any legal complaints against Brussels, not least because Thailand this year gave the go-ahead to restart stalled talks over a free-trade agreement with the EU.\nInstead, Thailand would become more vocal about the economic impacts of the EU directive and perhaps join Malaysia and Indonesia's Joint Task Force set up in June with the European Union that saw its first roundtable discussions in August, the official said.\nWhat do Indonesia and Malaysia want?\nChris Humphrey, executive director of the EU-ASEAN Business Council, said his organization has long been worried \"about the possibility of concerns from Southeast Asian nations on the EU Green Deal escalating into a significant trade dispute.\"\n\"There are legitimate concerns over implementation, but equally, the objectives of the policies are also legitimate,\" Humphrey added.\n\"It is clear to us that more needs to be done to bridge the gap between both the EU and ASEAN, but that is being done now and hopefully will prevent a further escalation of the dispute.\"\nIndeed, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur have steered away from their legal challenges and now seem more focused on negotiations with Brussels to lessen the impact of green directives on their economies.\nAs part of a new forum established this year, the two countries are lobbying the EU to be classified as low-risk countries for deforestation, which would simplify due diligence procedures for their companies. Countries deemed a high risk will still have more rigorous checks.\nThey also want the EU's demands to conform to the international standard laid out in 2004, under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, and to match deforestation laws of national governments.\n\"It is now our common responsibility to find a solution to regional concerns about the ability of smaller Southeast Asian suppliers to compete,\" said David McAllister, chair of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\"This should be done in a non-patronizing tone of mutual respect,\" he told DW.\n\"Through joint certification, the Joint Task Force that brings producing countries and the European Commission together, as well as through financial support for forest partnerships, we can make meaningful progress.\"\nAccording to a European Commission official speaking on condition of anonymity, the EU is \"significantly stepping up its engagement \u2026 to ensure the new law is effectively implemented while working in partnership with producer countries.\"\nThe official said a new initiative related to these disputes will be launched at COP28, which is set to begin in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\nEdited by: Wesley Rahn", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/malaysia-indonesia-seek-allies-in-eu-deforestation-row/a-67564595", "article_date_publish": "2023-11-27 14:16:17", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2023-11-27 14:33:07+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>Leakage found -- \"expected by late 2024\" indirectly hints at the answer (December 2024). \n        Replacement -- <b>Source of Truth</b>: The question will resolve based on the official EU announcement or documentation specifying the implementation date for larger companies under the deforestation regulation.</li>\n    <li>Leakage found -- \"expected by late 2024\" indirectly hints at the answer (December 2024). \n        Replacement -- <b>Resolution Date</b>: The resolution occurs when the EU publicly confirms the implementation date.</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>What will be the implementation start date for larger companies under the EU deforestation regulation, as per the article?</question_title>\n<background>The EU Deforestation-Free Regulation aims to ban imports of agricultural products linked to deforestation.

{"article_title": "Winnie-the-Pooh: When cuddly toys turn into monsters", "article_description": "In the new horror flick \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,\" a beloved children's book character mutates into a killer. But it's happened before.", "article_maintext": "Winnie-the-Pooh, the cuddly and wise bear, is not the first character most would think to cast as the murderous villain of a slasher movie. So it was indeed curious when images and footage from the R-rated horror movie with the ominous title \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" went viral online in 2022.\nAfter the copyrights to Alan Alexander Milne's classic children's books \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" expired on January 1, 2022, the character became part of the public domain. As a result, since then, anyone can use and depict the iconic figure as they wish.\nThe first images from \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" appeared in last May last year. The idea of a slasher movie starring the yellow furry animal and his best pal, Piglet \u2014 also feral and bloodthirsty \u2014 was met with mixed reactions on the web. Some found Pooh's mutation into a killer funny, while others called for the film to be banned.\nDespite bad reviews, the film has become a box office hit. The low-budget production, made with just $100,000 (\u20ac94,165), was originally planned for a streaming-only release and just a single day in cinemas. But following an initial release in Mexico on January 27 and in the US and different countries on February 15, it has already earned over $3 million at the global box offices, according to Box Office Mojo.\nDirector Frake-Waterfield gets death threats\nIn the film, an adult Christopher Robin returns to the Hundred Acre Wood, where his childhood friends Winnie-the-Pooh and others live. Pooh and Piglet, however, have become murderous creatures.\nThe difference between the horror Pooh and the original is clear: Instead of a red T-shirt, he wears a lumberjack shirt, and wears a Pooh mask and rubber gloves.\nThe film's director, Rhys Frake-Waterfield, said he has even received death threats from Winnie-the-Pooh fans. But at the same time, the British director told Associated Press he was completely overwhelmed by the film's surprise success.\n\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" isn't the first horror film in which seemingly innocuous characters commit gruesome murders.\nIn Ivan Reitman's popular 1984 scary comedy \"Ghostbusters,\" the chaotic hero squad's adversary, an ancient malevolent god named Gozer, attacks New York in the form of a giant marshmallow man, a fictional advertising figure for a candy popular in the United States. Although the ghost hunters' rival is constantly grinning, he's still hellbent on destroying everything in his path.\nMarshmallow men and furry animals\n\"Ghostbusters,\" unlike \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,\" had a large budget of $31 million (\u20ac29 million). The film was extremely successful and grossed almost 10 times that amount worldwide and is one of the most successful films of all time.\nSeveral sequels followed, most recently \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\" with another part scheduled for release in 2023.\n\"Gremlins,\" also released in 1984, is a horror comedy by director Joe Dante in which an inventor named Randall Peltzer buys a small furry animal named Gizmo from a mysterious dealer in Chinatown to give to his son Billy.\nIt's a mogwai, a Chinese demon, but harmless in this case. However, when the cute fellow gets wet, numerous vicious devils burst out of him, which subsequently turn into reptilian monsters and terrorize the idyllic small town where the Peltzers live.\nThe film grossed $148 million in the US alone. The sequel \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" followed in 1990.\nMurderous Chucky\nThe slasher film \"Child's Play,\" about the murderous doll Chucky, is pure horror flick material, unlike \"Gremlins\" or \"Ghostbusters.\" Despite its toy antagonist, it's not kid stuff.\nAlthough it wasn't an immediate hit when it was released in 1988, over time it became a cult classic among horror fans and was even expanded into a film series.\nIn the original film, the ghost of serial killer Charles Lee Ray is transported into a child's doll thanks to a voodoo ritual.\nWhether murderous or not, Winnie-the-Pooh is unlikely to be the last character moving into public domain that will be used in unexpected ways. Other famous characters that can soon be used by the public include Mickey Mouse in his original form in \"Steamboat Willie\" (1928), Bugs Bunny, Batman and Superman.\nThe director of \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,\" Rhys Frake-Waterfield, is also looking forward to this: \"There's going to be so many different and cool unique iterations coming off that. I might do one.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/winnie-the-pooh-when-cuddly-toys-turn-into-monsters/a-64801823", "article_date_publish": "2023-02-28 10:58:11", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2023-02-28 11:27:30+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>How much will \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" gross at the global box office by the end of February 2023?</question_title>\n<background>\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a low-budget horror film based on the public domain character Winnie-the-Pooh.

{"article_title": "Fleeing Ukraine war, Russian deserters find refuge in France", "article_description": "France has become the first EU country to admit former Russian soldiers without a passport. They oppose the Ukraine war, and now want to apply for asylum.", "article_maintext": "\"Deserters are not traitors, and desertion is not a crime, because there is no other way out of this situation,\" said Alexander. The young Russian man said it is \"a reasonable decision for a well-educated person not to take part in a war of aggression.\"\nAlexander is one of six Russian deserters who have arrived in Paris in recent months. He didn't want to give his family name, to protect his identity. They first fled to Kazakhstan, and then on to France during 2022 and 2023. They are now hoping to be granted political asylum.\nPro Asyl, a German human rights and refugee protection association, estimates that at least 250,000 military conscripts have sought protection in other countries from February 2022, when Russia launched its war against Ukraine, through September 2023.\nMost have sought safety in Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, Serbia and Israel. There are reports, however, that deserters have been deported back to Russia from Kazakhstan and Armenia.\nPro Asyl said only a few Russian soldiers fled to any of the Schengen states. Reaching these countries is challenging, and EU countries have very restrictive visa regulations.\nFrance sets precedent\nFrance has now become the first EU country to allow former military personnel who oppose Russia's war on Ukraine to enter the country without a passport. However, the men were previously vetted in Kazakhstan to rule out any issues.\n\"I understand the concerns of Western countries and why they do not hand out travel documents to many deserters, as they could include Russian secret service agents or war criminals,\" said Alexander. This is why the men's journey from Russia and onward travel was monitored.\n\"We checked the background of all six deserters,\" Alexei Alshansky of the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), an independent investigative organization originally from Russia, told DW. CIT itself was forced to leave Russia in 2022.\nAlshansky is a former member of the Russian military who has helped deserters come to France. \"At some point, we contacted human rights activists in the EU and then the advocacy work began, lasting a year,\" said Alshansky. \"The deserters were in Kazakhstan that whole time.\"\n'I didn't know why we were in Ukraine'\nOf the six men now hoping to be granted asylum in France, only Alexander was directly involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where he served as an officer. In the winter of 2022, he was stationed in Crimea, which had been annexed by Russia.\nAt first, everything looked as if Russia was running a military exercise, he told DW. But on February 24, 2022, all soldiers were sent off in a convoy.\n\"There was no order to attack Ukraine, there were no instructions, we simply crossed the Ukrainian border and only then did we realize what was going on,\" Alexander recalled. \"I was shocked and didn't know why we were in Ukraine.\"\nHe said he did not want to take part in the military operation, but he was also aware that he could not simply turn back.\n\"Either my own people would have shot me, or I would have been arrested at the border. I needed a legal way to get back to Russia,\" he said.\nWhen he was finally granted leave and returned home to Russia, he immediately applied for his discharge from the army. But in September 2022, Russia announced a partial mobilization.\n\"It was clear to me I would either be jailed or sent back to the front line, unless I fled Russia,\" he said.\nStopover in Kazakhstan\nKazakhstan is one of the few countries Russians can enter without a passport. Many Russian men have sought refuge there, including Alexander. After arriving in the country, he contacted human rights activists through acquaintances and applied for asylum.\n\"I knew it would be difficult to get protection in Kazakhstan, as Kazakhstan is still dependent on Russia to a certain extent,\" he said. \"I wasn't granted refugee status, but at least my legal stay was extended.\"\nAlexander also visited Western embassies seeking help. \"I knew that I couldn't apply for asylum there, and that I could only do so on the territory of the country,\" he said.\nAfter two years in Kazakhstan, he was finally able to leave for France. \"We were given permission to enter France because we actively oppose the war, not because we were deserters,\" he said.\nNo evidence of war crimes\n\"His involvement in the [Russian] invasion [of Ukraine] was not up to him,\" said CIT's Alshansky, even as he admitted that one cannot be absolutely sure that the deserters' stories are true.\nThat said, there is no evidence Alexander committed war crimes in Ukraine. \"He should therefore be granted humanitarian protection, and it is a great fortune he has received it,\" said Alshansky.\nAlshansky is also aware that Ukrainians cannot understand why former Russian soldiers are granted such protection. For Ukrainians, \"it may be difficult to see the situation from the other side [of the conflict] and realize that not all Russian soldiers want to fight in Ukraine,\" he said. There were a lot of Russian soldiers who only wanted to survive and may not necessarily have wanted to fight.\nAlshansky pointed out that international law says a person is not automatically classified as a war criminal just because they participate in a war. \"In the context of armed conflict, humanitarian law guarantees protection to all persons who are not involved in committing war crimes,\" he said.\nRussian deserters get no support at home\nThe number of Russian deserters has been growing since the beginning of the Ukraine war, according to CIT. This large section of the Russian population does not get any support from Russian society, even though deserting is \"a really courageous step,\" according to Alshansky.\n\"When someone attends an anti-war demonstration holding a 'no to war' placard and then spends several days behind bars as a result, they are considered a hero,\" he said. \"Such people can get a visa for another country, there are international programs for them. But if someone flees Russia after spending weeks in a pit, starving and being beaten because they refused to take part in Putin's war, they get no support.\"\nRussian deserters usually only receive support from foreign human rights organizations. \"Russian civil society is not inclined to help deserters,\" said Alshansky. \"It is basically paralyzed when it learns that a person has fled the Russian army. This attitude is unfair, to say the least.\"\nThe six Russian deserters taken in by France are now doing their bit to help other Russian men fleeing the army. They have even established an association called \"Adieu, weapons!\"\nThis article was originally written in Russian.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/fleeing-ukraine-war-russian-deserters-find-refuge-in-france/a-70665369", "article_date_publish": "2024-11-02 17:23:30", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-11-03 12:03:10+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>Leakage found -- The source of truth mentions \"November 2, 2024,\" which indirectly reveals the answer by specifying the exact date of the article containing the answer.  \n    Replacement -- <b>Source of Truth</b>: The question will resolve based on the number of Russian deserters explicitly stated in a credible report or article published in November 2024.</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>How many Russian deserters have arrived in France seeking asylum by November 2024?</question_title>\n<background>Since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine in February 2022, many Russian soldiers have deserted and fled to other countries to avoid participation in the conflict.

Here's a lowdown of who is who.", "article_maintext": "Organized crime among Arab, Kurdish and Turkish communities has come to play a central role in German movies and TV series. Part of that interest has been sparked by a number of high-profile heists.\nOn Tuesday, one of them made the headlines again when a fifth suspect was arrested in Berlin for the spectacular robbery last year of Dresden's Gr\u00fcnes Gew\u00f6lbe (\"Green Vault\") museum when invaluable historical jewelry was taken.\nIn contrast to notorious motorbike gangs or mafia groups, the groups referred to in German media and by police as \"clans\" define themselves by their family ties and a shared ethnic identity. But critics say the term \"clan crime\" puts family members under general suspicion, discriminating against those who are not criminals. \"Clan crime\" makes up less than 10% of organized crime investigations.\nThe Remmos\nThe Remmo family first came to police attention in 1992 with the murder of a restaurant owner in Berlin. Since then, some of the estimated 500 family members have turned the Remmo clan into one of Berlin's most notorious gangs with a long record of violence, drug trafficking, money laundering and fraud.\nThe theft of a hundred-kilo gold coin from the Berlin Bode Museum in 2017 is considered to be the Remmo clan's most spectacular coup. Police believe the gold, worth more than \u20ac3 million ($3.6 million), is believed to have been cut to pieces and melted. Gold particles, as well as glass fragments from the museum, have been found in apartments, vehicles, and on the clothes of Remmo family members. Two young men from the Remo family and one of their associates were sentenced to several years in prison in 2020 in connection with the theft.\nProsecutors also believe that members of the Remmo clan were involved in the \"Green Vault\" robbery in Dresden in 2019.\nThe Remmos belong to the Mhallami ethnic group, primarily native to southern Turkey and Lebanon. The Remmo family had fled war-torn Lebanon and came to Europe in the 1980s. The Mhallami mostly identify as Arab and are sometimes associated with Kurdish minorities.\nThe Abou-Chakers\nAlthough smaller than the Remmo clan, the Abou-Chaker family and its head Arafat Abou-Chaker have attracted attention from both media and authorities in Germany for a long time.\nBerlin-based Arafat Abou-Chaker took over management for Bushido, Germany's biggest gangsta rapper, in 2008. The business relationship sparked a stir (and a hit movie), before turning sour 10 years later.\nBushido then got embroiled in a court case against Arafat Abou-Chaker, accusing him of coercion, threats, and harassment. Over the years, Abou-Chaker family members have been indicted for several crimes such as intimidation, robbery, and bodily injury. A Berlin court also dealt with several Abou-Chaker members over forged documents to sell an apartment block that did not belong to them.\nThe Abou-Chaker family is of Palestinian origin and fled from a Lebanese refugee camp to Europe when civil war raged in Lebanon. Just like other suspected crime families, the Abou-Chakers are believed to own several offices and other real estates in Germany.\nThe Miris\nThe Miri clan consists of several families of Mhallami origin. They, too, are believed to have fled to Germany at the height of the Lebanon civil war in the early 1980s. The Miri clan sometimes referred to as \"M-Clan,\" is particularly active in Lower Saxony, though criminal activities have also been recorded in Berlin, Bremen, and North Rhine-Westphalia.\nMembers of the Miri clan have been involved in crimes such as drug trafficking, extortion, and pimping prostitutes. Some prominent figures of the clan are said to have close ties to the banned motorcycle gang \"Mongols MC.\"\nThe leader Ibrahim Miri became well-known across Germany when he violated a ban on returning to Germany after having been deported to Lebanon in 2019. At the time, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer proposed a \"Lex Miri\" that would allow for deported asylum seekers to be locked up when re-entering Germany.\nAl-Zein\nWith several thousand members, the Al-Zein clan might be one of the largest families involved in organized crimes in Germany. Its supposed boss, Mahmoud Al-Zein, published his memoirs in 2020, entitled, \"The godfather of Berlin: My way, my family, my rules.\"\nIn his memoir, Al-Zein provides an insight into the world of clan criminality. A world that seems to be dominated by archaic ideas of honor and strict hierarchies.\nMahmoud Al-Zein came from Lebanon to Germany in 1982. Since then, his own rules often collided with German laws: He has been convicted for drug trafficking and other criminal offenses.", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/clan-crime-the-whos-who-of-germanys-most-notorious-crime-families/a-57570978?maca=en-rss-en-ger-1023-rdf", "article_date_publish": null, "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2021-05-18 16:03:06+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>Leakage found -- The example provided (\"Remmo family\" or \"Abou-Chaker family\") includes the actual answer (\"Remmo clan\"), which indirectly reveals it. \nReplacement -- The answer must match the spelling and naming convention used in the source (e.g., \"Smith family\" or \"Johnson family\").

Current President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is backed by all mainstream parties and is seen as almost certain to win.", "article_maintext": "Almost 1,500 delegates gathered in Berlin on Sunday to choose Germany's president \u2014 a largely ceremonial position \u2014 for the next five years.\nThe so-called Bundesversammlung (Federal Convention) consists of the members of Germany's Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, along with an equal number of delegates chosen by the country's 16 states, or L\u00e4nder.\nAmong the latter delegates are some well-known personalities, including former Chancellor Angela Merkel, the national football coach, Hansi Flick, leading virologist Christian Drosten and the pianist Igor Levit.\n\u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, who as co-founder of the pharmaceutical company BioNTech was one of the driving forces behind the rapid development of the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine, is also among those selected to vote.\nWho are the candidates?\nCurrent President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, 66, a Social Democrat who served two stints as Merkel's foreign minister and previously was chief of staff to Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, is widely seen as a clear favorite to win the election.\nA recent opinion poll indicated that 85% of people living in Germany thought he was doing a good job, and he enjoys the support both of the ruling coalition and the mainstream conservative opposition parties.\nThe three other candidates are left-winger Gerhard Trabert, 65, who is running for the opposition Left Party, physicist Stefanie Gebauer, 41, who was nominated by a political group called the Free Voters, and Max Otte, 57, an archconservative economist chosen by the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nThe latter choice made waves in the German political scene, as Otte is not a member of the AfD and remains a part of the mainstream Christian Democrats (CDU).

{"article_title": "How Germany's politics is reflected in football stands", "article_description": "German football fans have been staging protests against the far-right AfD, and many fan groups have been redoubling their efforts to fight racism. But the country's general rightward shift is reflected in the stands.", "article_maintext": "Germany's shift to the right has left its mark on the country's national game, causing all kinds of ructions.\nMany German football clubs and fan groups have held demonstrations against the far right over the past year, both in the stadiums on match days and in the streets of their cities. Several major clubs from Germany's top two leagues, including Werder Bremen, VfL Bochum, FSV Mainz 05, 1. FC K\u00f6ln, and Hannover 96, have called on their supporters to oppose right-wing extremism.\nThe sustained success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) appears to have sharpened attention leading up to the federal election on February 23: At a recent home game at St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based club with a strong anti-fascist tradition, fans made their feelings known by chanting: \"The whole of Hamburg hates the AfD!\"\nThey also marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27 by holding up a banner that read: \"Those who fight against Nazis can't rely on the state.\"\nMore racism, more politics\nBut this outpouring of political sentiment is far from universal \u2014 and, for some politically engaged football fans, if anything the overall trend among fans in recent years has been to shy away from overt displays of political allegiance.\n\"I'd like them to have more courage,\" said Rico Noack, chairman of Gesellschaftsspiele (\"social games\"), an organization of football fans that helps promote an inclusive society. Too often, he said, he has seen \"fan groups negotiate among themselves, decide something is 'too political,' then they settle on the smallest possible consensus, or they don't say anything at all.\"\nThis is paradoxical, because Germany's culture wars have often focused on football, by far the country's most popular sport and a major presence in German society. The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, for instance, turned political when the German national football team declared its intention to take to the pitch with \"One Love\" armbands to protest the host country's laws on LGBTQ+ people.\nSimilarly, last year, when Germany hosted the European championships, the AfD used the opportunity to launch its own attack on what it deemed \"wokeness\" in football. Maximilian Krah, the party's leading candidate in the June European election, described the men's national team on TikTok as a \"politically correct mercenary troop.\"\n\"It is the rainbow team, the pride team,\" he said, referring to the team's defense of LGBTQ+ rights. \"We can ignore it.\"\n\"Football is more political than ever,\" Noack told DW. He sees the rightward shift in Germany's political culture reflected in football culture, though \"it's not like you see actual right-wing banners\" in the stadiums, he added.\nBut both Noack and the journalist Ronny Blaschke, who has just published a book about racism in football, have noticed that racism has become less of a taboo in the stands.\n\"Especially after the so-called refugee crisis in 2015, we have observed a shift to the right in the stadiums as we have more racist incidents on the stands against Black football players,\" Blaschke told DW's Dana Sumlaji. \"We have massive racism and social media, so whenever you have Black German national players for the youth teams or for the national team, you can look in the comment sections of social media and find many racist comments.\"\nOther demonstrators 'could learn a lot from organized football fans'\nGerman football fan culture is complex. Some clubs, like St. Pauli, have long had an overtly left-wing identity. Others, like Alemannia Aachen, are thought to have associations with the far-right scene \u2014 though the club itself has denied this.\nMany other clubs, meanwhile, harbor both left and right-wing fan groups. Noack has also noticed that, with some fan groups, whatever political identity they have becomes less important on match day, when club allegiance takes precedence.\nNoack is also skeptical that political football fan cultures can have a general effect on society. But he does think that football fans have a special power: When they do organize protests, they have a confrontational, rebellious spirit \u2014 combined with unity and a sense of humor \u2014 that regular anti-AfD demonstrations sometimes lack.\n\"You could learn a lot from organized football fans: Football fans are often very creative, they are good at knowing what to do to create effective images in the media,\" he said. \"The classic example is the use of pyrotechnics and smoke bombs \u2014 they are always the pictures that get printed. Certainly, other demonstrators could learn something from that.\"\n'It feels like the last stand fighting for democracy in Germany'\nSusanne Franke is board member of the Schalker Fan Initiative \u2014 an anti-racist organization of Schalke fans founded in 1992, when violent right-wing hooligans were a regular sight in football stadiums.\nSchalke is based in the town of Gelsenkirchen, in what was formerly Germany's industrial heartland in the Ruhr Valley. Though it was once a stronghold for the center-left Social Democrats, industrial decline in Gelsenkirchen has turned the town into one of the poorest cities in Germany, and the far-right AfD has gained ground. The club's neighbor and biggest rival, Borussia Dortmund, also has a much-feared neo-Nazi contingent in its fan base dating back to the 1970s.\nFranke is concerned that football culture is reverting back to those days. \"It had got better, and now it is getting worse again. In many places fans are wrestling for control of the narrative,\" she told DW.\nFor Franke, the decision by Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz to pass a non-binding resolution through the German parliament with the help of the AfD has made her group's work all the more urgent. \"To me, it feels like the last stand fighting for democracy in Germany,\" she said. \"Whether you're a football fan or not, it is very important that you take this moment very seriously.\"\nThough there is no obvious evidence that football fans are any more or less politically engaged than anyone else, football's presence in German society often makes them more visible when they do express political views.\n\"Football has a huge chance, and a huge reach,\" said Franke. \"It is widely visible \u2014 in the news, in social media and in German society. This is why I honestly do hope that people will take an honest stand and say something.\"\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/how-germanys-politics-is-reflected-in-football-stands/a-71614152?maca=en-rss-en-ger-1023-rdf", "article_date_publish": "2025-02-15 08:07:18", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2025-02-15 14:51:50+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>Leakage found -- The title mentions \"far-right political movements,\" which indirectly hints at the answer (AfD).

Elsewhere, Arminia Bielefeld hosted the defending champions.", "article_maintext": "Bundesliga Matchday 4 headlines:\n- Super subs save Dortmund\n- Bayern sweep past Bielefeld\n- Poulsen stunner boosts Leipzig\n- No away wins\nSuper subs save Dortmund\nGio Reyna impressed, Thomas Meunier hit the bar, but Dortmund lacked punch against a Hoffenheim side that have long caused them trouble. Even without star striker Andrej Kramaric, one of two club players infected with the coronavirus following international duty, the hosts made life hard for Dortmund.Inevitably when Erling Haaland and Marco Reus came off the bench, they decided the game. Haaland, staying just onside, set up Reus to pass into an empty net. Given the non-stop run of games for players at the moment, Dortmund will be very happy about these three points.\nBayern sweep past Bielefeld\nThanks to a deeper squad, Bayern Munich were able to play most of their stars against Bielefeld having rested them for the German Cup just days before. The result was a strong win, two goals each for Robert Lewandowski and Thomas M\u00fcller, though a red card for Corentin Tolisso. For Arminia, the defeat was made all the more painful without their fans (the game was played behind closed doors due to high coronavirus infection rates in the city) but on-loan winger Ritsu Doan was a bright spark.\nPoulsen stunner boosts Leipzig\nIn the battle of the top two sides in the table, RB Leipzig got the better of strong starters Augsburg. Angelino scored a header for the second league game in a row just before the break, a goal that broke Augsburg. Yussuf Poulsen's goal \u2014 a thumping, first-time, cross-goal volley \u2014 just after the hour mark ended the contest. Marco van Basten would have been proud.\nNo away wins\nPerhaps it was just the fixture list this weekend or perhaps it was the lack of enough or any fans that meant the fourth weekend of the Bundesliga season ended without a home win. Freiburg and Gladbach should have won, while Hertha lost to Stuttgart in Berlin for the first time since 2013. Also of note, there were four 1-1 draws on the same matchday, the first time since the penultimate round of the 2016-17 season.\nPlayer of the week: Thomas M\u00fcller (Bayern)\nThomas M\u00fcller looks to be benefiting from not being a part of the international set-up anymore. After playing and scoring in Bayern's German Cup game during midweek, M\u00fcller's fine form continued on Saturday evening against Bielefeld. The 31-year-old scored two and assisted one in a dominant win. Is another record-breaking season on the way?\nYoung player of the week: Ismail Jakobs (Cologne)\nCologne earned their first point of the season and while 21-year-old left-sided winger Ismail Jakobs wasn't involved in the equalizer, he was a big positive for the home side. Regularly looking to drive towards goal, Jakobs posed a problem for Frankfurt down the left. Perhaps this will be his breakout season.\nCoach of the week: Pellegrino Matarazzo (Stuttgart)\nMatarazzo secured Stuttgart's first win in the Olympiastadion in seven years. Stuttgart's early set-piece goal put them in a confident spot and a strong defensive showing, particularly in the second half when Hertha Berlin pushed for an equalizer, along with a game-ending counterattack was a sign this Stuttgart side is maturing.

And the issue of religious dress goes to the heart of that.

She played for the Atlas Lionesses, who reached the second round at their first-ever World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\nBut it was not long ago that football governing body FIFA lifted its ban on the hijab, declaring it safe to wear during football matches.

As an example, tumors often perturb microRNA networks to grow.\"\nNobel Prize microRNA discovery started with a tiny roundworm\nThis Nobel Prize is all about foundational genetics.\nAt the heart of what makes a living organism function is the ability of double-stranded DNA to be translated by single-stranded RNA molecules. These \"messenger\" RNA (mRNA) create an \"information molecule\" from DNA and move into a cell\u2019s protein factory \u2014 a ribosome \u2014 where amino acids align to this template and then fold into specialized proteins.\nThese proteins are the building blocks of all living organisms. But mutations or variations to genes can cause changes in function \u2014 often benign, but potentially disease-causing.\nThis general pathway to organism metabolism has been understood for a long time, but as K\u00e4mpe posed, \"What determines that only the right genes are transcribed into messenger RNA and then translated into the right, tissue-specific proteins at the right time?\"\nThe answer starts with one specific organism, the roundworm species Caenorhabditis elegans. Despite its size, the roundworm has 20,000 genes that code for proteins \u2014 about the same number as a human, making it an ideal lab \u2018model\u2019 for physiological research.\nDifferent mutations to C. elegans genes were found to cause growth changes. One triggered excessive growth via a repeating developmental pathway. Another restricted growth due to a different gene variation.\nAmbros found the enlarging \"lin-4\" variant in 1993, with Ruvkun isolating the \"lin-14\" mutation present in the miniature worms a year later. What wasn\u2019t clear was how these variations interacted and influenced cell regulation. The pair joined forces to find the answer.\nA micro discovery leads to big implications for science\nAmbros and Ruvkun found their respective mutations interacted \u2014 specifically, that a sequence of code on the lin-4 gene corresponded to part of a lin-14 sequence.\nThis was the critical moment when microRNA was determined to exist, as a distinct form of RNA.\n\"At this point they had discovered a novel and unexpected mechanism of gene regulation \u2014 microRNA,\" said K\u00e4mpe. \"For a long time, however, microRNA was believed to be an oddity peculiar to C. elegans.\"\nIt required more evidence to confirm their findings.\nIt came in 2000, when Ruvkun found another gene \u2014 \"let-7\" \u2014 which was found not just in roundworm, but in humans and most animals.\nMany microRNAs, it turns out, are highly conserved across animals, plants and fungi, meaning that they are largely unchanged from species-to-species and across hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.\nMore than 1,000 microRNA genes have been found in humans.\n\"Every microRNA regulates several genes,\" said K\u00e4mpe. \"And each mRNA is regulated by many distinct microRNAs, creating a robust system for gene regulation.\"\nWhen did RNA enter the public spotlight?\nRNA was thrust into the public consciousness with the rise of RNA-based vaccine technology at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThese vaccine products could be developed relatively quickly by creating imitation proteins based on small sections of genetic code from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWhen used in a vaccine, these proteins provide a non-disease-causing target for the human immune system to find and create antibodies ready for the real virus.\nKatalin Kariko and Drew Weissman were awarded last year\u2019s prize for their work developing mRNA vaccine technology.\nHowever while last year\u2019s prize was very much in recognition of work that had led to direct medical applications, this year\u2019s is more research focused.\n\"This year\u2019s prize is definitely a physiology prize,\" said Professor Gunilla Karlsson Hederstam, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine. \"Last year, of course, [was] much a more applied discovery that was translated into vaccine development, so two quite different prizes.\n\"Although there are no very clear applications available yet, understanding them, knowing that they exist, understanding their regulatory networks is always the first step.\"\nWhy type of products are being developed which utilize microRNA technology?\nSo while this year\u2019s prize is very much focused on discovery rather than application, the realization of the Ambros-Ruvkun research may not be far away. There are currently several vaccine-type products in clinical trial stage for cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases that use microRNA technology.\nThe challenge is hitting the right target. Take a cancer cell. There may be a specific gene that a vaccine needs to address, but microRNAs regulate many different genes. The risk is that a product may act more like a bulldozer than a scalpel.\n\"But there might be ways around that,\" said K\u00e4mpe, \"Tumors quite often perturb the microRNA networks and they can do that by deleting the genes or mutating the genes that process the microRNA.\n\"In [this] case there are promising first tests to see if you can modulate the RNA-binding proteins, but to deliver microRNAs to cells and think you get one effect, I think will be very difficult.\"\nTwo more Nobel science prizes will be awarded this week, with the physics laureate to be revealed on Tuesday, and chemistry prize on Wednesday.\nWhat is the history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine?\nThis year's Prize, set at 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1.06 million USD), is yet another recognition of genetic discovery.\nArthur Kornberg and Severo Ochoa were recognized in 1959 for identifying the synthesis mechanisms of DNA and RNA, while the famed trio Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the prize in 1952 for unravelling the DNA Double Helix.\nFire and Mello (2006), and Karik\u00f3 and Weissman (2023) have also had their work on RNA recognized.\nFamed Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was nominated for his work in Physiology and Medicine but was never named as a recipient.\nAt 31, Canadian surgeon and pharmacologist Frederick G. Banting is the youngest recipient of the Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He was recognized in 1923 for his discovery of insulin.\nThe American pathologist Francis Peyton Rous is the oldest, receiving his award in 1966 aged 87 for his discovery of tumor-inducing viruses.\nThe prize has been declined once. In 1939, Gerhard Domagk was prevented by Germany's Nazi Government from receiving his award for his discovery of an antibiotic against Streptococcus infections. He was later able to receive his diploma and medal in 1947.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/us-scientists-victor-ambros-gary-ruvkun-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine/a-70374530?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-xml-atom", "article_date_publish": "2024-10-07 09:37:42", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-10-08 10:53:33+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Who will win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2024?</question_title>\n<background>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded annually by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine.</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n      <b>Source of Truth</b>: The question will resolve when the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet publicly announces the official 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate(s)\u2014typically via a press release on NobelPrize.org.  \n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <b>Resolution Date</b>: The resolution occurs on the calendar date when the 2024 laureate(s) are formally named (typically early October 2024). \n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <b>Accepted Answer Format</b>: The full name(s) of the laureate(s) exactly as given in the announcement should be provided.

{"article_title": "Omar Marmoush: How Bundesliga forged Manchester City star", "article_description": "Mo Salah's Egyptian teammate Omar Marmoush has gone from largely unknown to big money Manchester City signing. But his rise to prominence in Germany's Bundesliga was not always smooth.", "article_maintext": "Omar Marmoush spent the first half of this season tearing the Bundesliga up. Now, after a \u20ac75 million ($79 million) move to struggling English champions Manchester City was confirmed on Thursday, he will be hoping to repeat the trick in the Premier League.\n\"It's a pleasure and an honour for me and my family to be representing Manchester City. It makes them happy; it makes me happy that my dreams are becoming a reality,\" Marmoush said on the Manchester City website. \"The last two seasons have been great, but it is just the beginning for me.\"\nThe Egyptian was a key figure for Eintracht Frankfurt, with his dynamic footwork and finishing flair bringing many a defender to their knees, and will be sorely missed.\n\"The way he's gotten himself stuck in and won over crowds, not to mention how decisive his goals and assists are, it's clear he feels at home here,\" Frankfurt coach Dino Toppm\u00f6ller told German sports magazine kicker before his departure.\nWhile fans will have to get used to a Bundesliga without Marmoush's name in the headlines, the 25-year-old's first years in Germany were anything but easy.\nMarmoush's Egyptian education\n\"As a kid I dreamed of being a pro footballer. And sometimes in school I wasn't exactly the best, so it was my only way,\" Marmoush told the DFL, the company that operates the Bundesliga in late 2024.\nBorn and raised in Egypt's capital Cairo, Marmoush, like many, had dreams of a football life from a young age. Though he says his parents were initially skeptical of his love of the sport and hoped he'd focus more on his education, he soon won them over.\n\"After I started to take bigger steps they saw the potential and said: 'Ok, you can do this.' They support me every day, they're the biggest thing in my life,\" Marmoush said.\nMarmoush began playing at Cairo's American International School, where he was also attending classes. The school's football coach, Ahmed Elagroudy, still vividly remembers him as a youngster.\n\"Since Marmoush was in grade seven, it was obvious he's going to be a brilliant football player. I could see this on the pitch, he was one of our main players,\" Elagroudy told the DFL.\nThe strengths that make Marmoush stand out today were already apparent in Cairo.\n\"As he grew older, things got even better. It started to be clear he's a great scorer, it's like his foot always knew the way to the goal.\"\nElagroudy encouraged his pupil to make the jump to nearby Egyptian Premier League side Wadi Degla. After just a few weeks in their youth setup, he was promoted to the first team and made enough of an impression to represent Egypt at the U-20 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) back in 2017.\nA bumpy start in the Bundesliga\nMarmoush's AFCON appearance caught Wolfsburg's eye, and the Bundesliga side lured the 18-year-old striker to Germany, signing him to their reserves. As thrilling as the jump to Europe was, it was a difficult transition.\n\"It was not an easy step to leave my family, friends and country to come live here in Germany, where I don't know the language, the food, everything, honestly,\" said Marmoush. \"And this was the biggest challenge, not just to play in these European conditions and how fast the football is, but also on the mental side. It took me a bit of time to learn how to live here.\"\nThree years later, at age 21, Marmoush broke into Wolfsburg's first team to make his Bundesliga debut.\nLoans to then-second division St. Pauli and later Stuttgart demonstrated flashes of brilliance, but he was far from a household name. Despite a few spectacular goals, the 2022-23 season proved to be Marmoush's last at Wolfsburg as he headed south to Frankfurt that offseason.\nFrankurt fan favorite and Egypt impact\nDino Toppm\u00f6ller's Eintracht \u2014 where high pressure and quick, direct play are king \u2014 proved a perfect fit for Marmoush. He enjoyed a career-best 17 goals in all competitions in 2023-24, setting the groundwork for this season's stunning form. Marmoush's performances also led to a striking partnership with Hugo Ekitike blossoming.\nHis excellent form has also cemented Marmoush's role for the Egyptian national team. Although eligible to play for Canada because his parents worked there long enough to earn citizenship, he elected to represent his country of birth and made his full team debut in 2021. He played in every game at the delayed 2022 AFCON in which Egypt finished runners-up, before scoring in the tournament two years later, when Egypt crashed out on penalties.\nMarmoush is now an established international and regularly runs out alongside personal hero Mo Salah, of Liverpool.\n\"It's a big pleasure. I'm so happy when I'm in the national team and playing with one of the best players in the world. To learn from him, both on the pitch but also off of it, and how he works and his professionalism. [Salah] is like an older brother to me,\" Marmoush said.\nAt 32, Salah's time as leader of the Egypt team is winding down, opening the door for Marmoush to be the next attacking focal point. Having established himself as such at Frankfurt, his next task is to standout among the galaxy of stars at City.\nThis article was originally published on November 8, 2024 and updated on January 24, 2025 with the news of Marmoush's transfer to Manchester City.\nEdited by: Jonathan Harding", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/omar-marmoush-how-the-bundesliga-forged-manchester-city-star/a-70733853?maca=en-rss-en-sports-1027-rdf", "article_date_publish": "2024-11-08 13:28:59", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2025-01-24 13:45:16+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>No leakage found</question_title>\n<background>No leakage found</background>\n<resolution_criteria>\n<ul>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n    <li>No leakage found</li>\n</ul>\n</resolution_criteria>\n</q1>\n</analysis>\n\n<q1>\n<question_id>0</question_id>\n<question_title>Which club will Omar Marmoush join after leaving Eintracht Frankfurt, as confirmed in January 2025?</question_title>\n<background>Omar Marmoush is an Egyptian professional footballer who played for Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga before transferring to another club.
