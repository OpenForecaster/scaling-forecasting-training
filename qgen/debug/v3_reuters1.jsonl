The project includes an important renewable energy element with a solar grid to power 70 villages.\n\"This groundbreaking will create a higher quality of life in many communities, and it will help Senegal\u2019s economy grow and prosper. It will also help Senegal get one step closer to its goal of universal electricity access by 2025,\" she said.\nYellen, who met women and youth entrepreneurs in Dakar on Friday, said the electrification project would allow Senegal to rely on energy sources that are within its borders, cost effective and not prone to the kind of volatility in energy prices sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nShe said the U.S. Power Africa project has helped connect 165 million people to reliable electricity across Africa.

Previous ballots have been criticised as one-sided and not credible by civil society groups such as Movimento Mudei, as well as academics and opposition parties.\nAround 14 million Angolans at home and abroad will head to the polls on Aug. 24 to vote in what is likely to be the tightest and tensest race since the first multi-party election in 1992.\n\"Nothing has changed in terms of the transparency of the election since 2017 so if the (ruling) MPLA sees that it's not doing well, it has the ability to falsify the results,\" said Justin Pearce, senior lecturer in history at South Africa's Stellenbosch University.\nThe MPLA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIt does not help that the government passed a law last year to centralise the final vote counting from all stations at home and abroad in the capital Luanda, a system that has raised fears about voter fraud, nor that most local media are state-controlled.\nCivil society groups have advocated for votes to be counted where they are cast, rather than centralising the system.\nThere will be 2,000 Angolans and at least 50 international observers keeping an eye on the polls, but in a country twice the size of France, they will be stretched.\nManuel Pereira da Silva, head of the electoral commission, which says its an independent body, told reporters earlier this month the electoral process would be impartial and transparent.\nAngola, Africa's second biggest oil producer but one of the continent's most unequal nations, emerged from civil war in 2002, a 27-year power struggle between former liberation movements, the MPLA, which has ruled since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, and UNITA. More than half a million people were killed.\n'FINALLY GOING TO VOTE'\nPresident Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, from the MPLA, is seeking a second five-year term but main opposition party UNITA looks more popular than ever.\nAn Afrobarometer survey in May showed the proportion of Angolans favouring UNITA, led by Adalberto Costa J\u00fanior, had increased from 13% in 2019 to 22%, seven points behind the MPLA. Nearly half of voters were still undecided, according to the survey.\nLouren\u00e7o was handpicked by his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who stepped down in 2017 after four decades in power, and was applauded for investigating allegations of corruption during the former president's era. But frustration persists at the MPLA's failures to improve the lives of most Angolans.\nUNITA is betting on younger voters and says it wants to create jobs and give them stability during a time of global crisis.\nIf UNITA wins, \"it would be the first time since I was born that I would see another party in power,\" said Silva.\nExpatriates previously had to travel home to exercise their right, until the law changed last year.\n\"I'm 51 and I'm finally going to vote,\" said an emotional restaurant chef Paulo Soares.\n\"It sounds to me that this was a strategy as MPLA's share of the vote declines in Angola to try and mobilise potential supporters outside the country,\" said Pearce.\nYet only 22,000 of the around 400,000 Angolans abroad registered to vote, a possible sign of how little faith they have in the process. Some complained they were unable to register because they lived too far from consulates or weren't given enough time to organise paperwork.\n\"There are a lot of people who don't believe in the election,\" said 30-year-old Filipe Gonga, who lives in the Netherlands. \"I don't believe it either, but I'm going to exercise my right.\"", "article_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/angolans-abroad-vote-first-time-wonder-if-it-will-change-anything-2022-08-17/", "article_date_publish": "2022-08-17 11:15:17", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2022-08-17 11:29:29+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which party will win the most votes in Angola's August 2022 election, based on the Afrobarometer survey?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Afrobarometer survey in May 2022 showed the proportion of Angolans favoring UNITA had increased from 13% in 2019 to 22%, seven points behind the MPLA.

He hopes they can now join him in Brazil.\nFriday said his journey to Brazil began on June 27, when a fisherman friend rowed him up to the stern of the Liberian-flagged Ken Wave, docked in Lagos, and left him by the rudder. To his surprise, he found three men already there, waiting for the ship to depart. Friday said he was terrified. He had never met his new shipmates and feared they could toss him into the sea at any moment.\nOnce the ship was moving, Friday said the four men made every effort not to be discovered by the ship's crew, who they also worried might offer them a watery grave.\n\"Maybe if they catch you they will throw you in the water,\" he said. \"So we taught ourselves never to make a noise.\"\nSpending two weeks within spitting distance of the Atlantic Ocean was perilous.\nTo prevent themselves from falling into the water, Friday said the men rigged up a net around the rudder and tied themselves to it with a rope. When he looked down, he said he could see \"big fish like whales and sharks.\" Due to the cramped conditions and the noise of the engine, sleep was rare and risky. \"I was very happy when we got rescued,\" he said.\nFather Paolo Parise, a priest at the Sao Paulo shelter, said he had come across other cases of stowaways, but never one so dangerous. Their journey paid testament to lengths people will go in search of a new start, he said. \"People do unimaginable and deeply dangerous things.\"", "article_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/four-nigerians-rescued-brazil-survived-14-days-ships-rudder-2023-08-01/", "article_date_publish": "2023-08-01 11:04:51", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2023-08-01 11:34:19+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Where will the four Nigerian stowaways land after their journey, as reported by Brazilian federal police?\",\n    \"background\": \"Stowaways sometimes attempt long and dangerous journeys to escape their home countries in search of better opportunities.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Europe\", \"Brazil\", \"United States\", \"Nigeria\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"How many of the four Nigerian stowaways will apply for asylum in Brazil, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"Migrants often seek asylum in countries where they land after perilous journeys.\",\n    \"options\": [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"4\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the primary reason cited by the Nigerian stowaways for leaving their country, as reported in the interview?\",\n    \"background\": \"Migrants often leave their home countries due to various push factors.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Natural disasters\", \"Economic hardship and political instability\", \"Religious persecution\", \"Family reunification\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the duration of the Nigerian stowaways' journey before being rescued, as reported by Brazilian authorities?\",\n    \"background\": \"Stowaways sometimes endure long and dangerous journeys.\",\n    \"options\": [\"5 days\", \"10 days\", \"14 days\", \"21 days\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the reaction of the Nigerian stowaways upon learning their landing location, as reported in the interview?\",\n    \"background\": \"Migrants sometimes have unexpected reactions upon reaching their destination.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Relief\", \"Shock\", \"Anger\", \"Indifference\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n\n<think>\nquestion 0 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is answerable based on the article, has a clear resolution (Brazilian federal police report), and options are distinct.\n- Cons: The question might be slightly predictable if the forecaster knows common stowaway routes, but the twist (landing in Brazil instead of Europe) makes it interesting.\n\nquestion 1 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is directly answerable from the article, has a clear resolution (Reuters report), and options are distinct.\n- Cons: The question is somewhat narrow and might not be as engaging as others.\n\nquestion 2 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is answerable from the article, has a clear resolution (interview), and options are distinct and cover plausible reasons.\n- Cons: The question might be seen as slightly overspecific, but the options cover broad categories.\n\nquestion 3 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is answerable from the article, has a clear resolution (Brazilian authorities), and options are distinct.\n- Cons: The question is somewhat factual and might not be as engaging for forecasting.\n\nquestion 4 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is answerable from the article, has a clear resolution (interview), and options are distinct and cover plausible reactions.\n- Cons: The question might be seen as slightly subjective, but the article clearly states their reaction.\n\ndeciding which question is best\n- Best: Question 0, as it has a clear resolution, is answerable from the article, and is engaging due to the unexpected landing location.\n- Next: Question 4, as it captures an emotional reaction, which is interesting for forecasting.\n- Then: Question 2, as it covers a broad reason for migration, which is relevant and answerable.\n- Followed by: Question 1, as it is answerable but narrower in scope.\n- Last: Question 3, as it is more factual and less engaging for forecasting.\n</think>\n\n```python\n[0, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n```"}

The real rose 1.24% to its highest level since January this year after the central bank hiked its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points to 3.5% late on Wednesday. The central bank also hinted at another rate hike in June to help curb rising inflation and support an economy hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The Brazilian central bank\u2019s hawkish stance, which is in line with current inflation projections, has helped support the BRL, and signals of an additional rate hike next month will give more power to the real in the short term,\u201d said Mauricio Une, senior economist at Rabobank. \"However, there are fiscal risks that persist which are primarily on account of rising coronavirus infections, which would in turn push the congress towards more stimulus measures to help support the economy.\" Colombia's peso surged 1.3% to break a five-day losing streak after its freshly-appointed finance minister said the country will seek to raise 14 trillion pesos ($3.6 billion) with a new tax reform. Mass protests and lawmaker opposition forced the withdrawal of the previous bill and his predecessor's resignation. The currency of the world's largest copper producer, Chile , gained 0.4% as copper prices flirted with 10-year peaks. MSCI's index of Latin American currencies gained 0.7%, while stocks rose 0.8%, primarily led by a weaker dollar and rising commodity prices. The dollar fell from a two-week high on Thursday as global market risk appetite improved, further supporting emerging market currencies. Shares of Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras fell 0.3% after it reopened bidding for its Golfinho offshore oilfield cluster, two sources told Reuters this week, following a rise in crude prices over the last several months. Elsewhere, the Turkish lira was flat after the bank held its key interest rate steady at 19%, above inflation, which the central bank expects to cool after having risen beyond 17%.

UK's governing party questions fiscal programme", "article_description": "Some lawmakers in Britain's governing Conservatives questioned on Friday whether their traditionally pro-low tax, small state party had moved too far to the left with a fiscal programme they said would punish their traditional voters.", "article_maintext": "LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Some lawmakers in Britain's governing Conservatives questioned on Friday whether their traditionally pro-low tax, small state party had moved too far to the left with a fiscal programme they said would punish their traditional voters.\nFinance minister Jeremy Hunt outlined on Thursday what his team pitched as a progressive fiscal statement that protected the poorest, but which will increase the tax burden for millions of Britons. Just hours later, some lawmakers from his own party were in talks over whether to vote against the budget plan.\nThey say Hunt's package of measures is a betrayal of some steadfast Conservative supporters - especially in more affluent constituencies, or electoral districts - who will now have to pay more tax.\nSome accused him of going too far in trying to restore Britain's reputation for sound finances, dashed by former prime minister Liz Truss's plans for unfunded tax cuts.\nBut with Rishi Sunak recently installed as the party's third prime minister this year, appetite for rebellion is likely to be limited, at least for now.\nOne Conservative lawmaker took aim at what he called \"stealth taxes\" on middle-class voters and the cut to the tax-free allowance on dividends, saying Hunt had all but ended any lingering hopes of winning a national election due in the next two years by moving too close to the opposition Labour Party.\n\"What was most interesting was that (Labour's finance policy chief) Rachel Reeves offered no alternative. In other words, we appear to have a Social Democrat government approved by a Social Democrat Labour Party,\" the Conservative lawmaker said on condition of anonymity.\n\"Where is the difference?\"\nThe lawmaker said some in the Conservative Party were holding calls on Friday to discuss whether to vote against Sunak and Hunt's programme.\nOne lawmaker, Esther McVey, said earlier this week she would vote against any measures to put up taxes if the government stuck by its pledge to build the High Speed 2 rail project. Hunt said on Thursday the government would deliver on the project.\nVOCAL MINORITY\nBut they might be a vocal minority within the party.\nAfter years of division and the ousting of two prime ministers in the space of 2-1/2 months, the Conservatives have seen their popularity slump, with Labour enjoying a more than 20 point lead over the governing party in opinion polls.\nSome lawmakers in more urban and poorer constituencies said Hunt's plans, which protected welfare benefits and matched pension increases to double-digit inflation, would benefit voters who had backed the party at the last election in 2019.\nUnder former prime minister Boris Johnson, the Conservatives scored a large majority after winning over many traditional Labour voters in northern and central England.\n\"This is a situation where you just need to hold your nose and vote for it,\" said one lawmaker. \"The government did well to fix the fiscal hole without raising the headline rates of taxes, while protecting the most vulnerable and key public services.\"\nThe approaching election might be the factor that saps any rebellion of momentum, with several lawmakers saying the party cannot afford any more infighting.\nBut their unity might be tested by a record drop in living standards over the next two years, with surging energy bills and food prices set to leave many households significantly poorer.\n\"Well some of my colleagues will criticise virtually anything because that is what they do,\" Roger Gale, a Conservative member of parliament, told Reuters.\n\"They need to grow up and live in the real world. The chancellor (finance minister) has done what the chancellor needed to do to get the economy back on track.\"", "article_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/are-we-still-conservatives-uks-governing-party-questions-fiscal-programme-2022-11-18/", "article_date_publish": "2022-11-18 13:38:19", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2022-11-18 14:11:28+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the outcome of the Conservative Party's vote on Jeremy Hunt's fiscal programme by December 2022, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Conservative Party is debating whether to support Jeremy Hunt's fiscal programme, which includes tax increases and protections for welfare benefits.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"The programme will pass with majority Conservative support.\",\n        \"The programme will pass but with significant Conservative dissent.\",\n        \"The programme will be rejected by Conservative lawmakers.\",\n        \"The vote will be postponed indefinitely.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 0\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which party will lead in opinion polls by January 2023, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Conservative Party's popularity has slumped, with Labour enjoying a significant lead in opinion polls.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Conservative Party\",\n        \"Labour Party\",\n        \"Liberal Democrats\",\n        \"Green Party\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the primary criticism of Jeremy Hunt's fiscal programme by Conservative lawmakers by December 2022, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"Conservative lawmakers have raised concerns about the fiscal programme's impact on traditional voters.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"It increases taxes on middle-class voters.\",\n        \"It reduces funding for public services.\",\n        \"It fails to address inflation.\",\n        \"It aligns too closely with Labour Party policies.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 3\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"How will the Conservative Party's internal unity be described by January 2023, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Conservative Party has faced internal divisions and leadership changes.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Fractured due to ongoing rebellions.\",\n        \"Stable but with minor dissent.\",\n        \"Unified with no dissent.\",\n        \"Disintegrating into factions.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the public perception of Jeremy Hunt's fiscal programme by January 2023, as reported by Reuters?\",\n    \"background\": \"The fiscal programme includes tax increases and protections for welfare benefits.\",\n    \"options\": [\n        \"Broadly popular among all voters.\",\n        \"Popular among traditional Conservative voters but unpopular elsewhere.\",\n        \"Unpopular among traditional Conservative voters but popular elsewhere.\",\n        \"Broadly unpopular among all voters.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n\n<think>\nquestion 0 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability:\n- Pros: The question is answerable from the article, has clear resolution criteria (by December 2022, as reported by Reuters), and the options are distinct and non-overlapping.\n- Cons: The background slightly hints at the answer by mentioning \"appetite for rebellion is likely to be limited,\" which could bias the forecaster.\n\nquestion 1 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability:\n- Pros: The question is straightforward, answerable from the article, and has clear resolution criteria (by January 2023, as reported by Reuters).

ChatGPT bar exam performance sparks differing opinions", "article_description": "When Open AI rolled out the latest version of ChatGPT in March, one particular statistic put the legal profession on its heels: The artificial intelligence technology outperformed nine out of 10 human test-takers.", "article_maintext": "May 31 (Reuters) - When Open AI rolled out the latest version of ChatGPT in March, one particular statistic put the legal profession on its heels: The artificial intelligence technology outperformed nine out of 10 human test-takers.\nBut a Ph.D. candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology now says that GPT-4\u2019s bar exam performance that put it in the 90th percentile of test-takers has likely been overstated, and that the chatbot actually lands in the neighborhood of the 68th percentile of real test-takers\u2014a conclusion the original researchers reject.\nThe percentile debate is centered on how the researchers who first looked at the GPT-4\u2019s bar exam performance calculated its score percentile\u2014wrote Eric Martinez in a new paper titled, \u201cRe-Evaluating GPT-4\u2019s Bar Exam Performance.\u201d\nGPT-4\u2019s Uniform Bar Exam score of 297 would have landed the program in the 90th percentile among those who took Illinois\u2019 February 2019 bar exam\u2014the benchmark cited by the original researchers. But Illinois\u2019 July bar exam would have yielded a more accurate comparison because the February exam typically draws a larger percentage of those retaking the exam after failing and who have lower scores, Martinez wrote.\nMeasured against a recent July exam in Illinois, GPT-4 would have scored in the 68th percentile, he concluded.\n\u201cThe fact that GPT-4\u2019s reported \u201890th percentile\u2019 capabilities were so widely publicized might pose some concerns that lawyers and non-lawyers may use GPT-4 for complex legal tasks for which it is incapable of adequately performing,\u201d Martinez wrote.\nChicago-Kent law professor Daniel Martin Katz and Michigan State law professor Michael James Bommarito, who conducted the original research alongside two others from legal AI company Casetext, said this week that they stand by their conclusions and the 90th percentile finding.\nHowever, Katz and Bommarito said they plan to \u201ccorrect points of confusion and misunderstanding that have arisen in public discourse\u201d in the upcoming final version of their research paper. The draft version published in March focuses on GPT-4\u2019s overall score, with the percentile conversion only appearing in a footnote.\nOpen AI did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\nThe differing pass rates on the February and July bar exams can be dramatic. For example, the pass rate on Illinois' most recent July exam was 68%, compared with 43% for February.\nMartinez, Bommarito and Katz all agree that converting GPT-4\u2019s Uniform Bar Exam score into a percentile is complicated by the fact that the National Conference of Bar Examiners, which designs the exam, does not publicly release score distributions, nor do states on a regular or consistent basis.\nKatz and Bommarito said that their 90th percentile conclusion is conservative, because they threw out GPT-4\u2019s high essay scores and because they used pre COVID-19 pandemic results for comparison.

They did not specify the terms of the deal.\nThe French regulator had no immediate comment. Spain's CNMC said only the negotiations were still ongoing.\nSpain is a growing producer of renewable energy that it exports to France and it wants its neighbour to pay most of the extra costs. That had led to disagreement amid wider tensions between them about pipeline connections and protectionism.\nTwo sources with knowledge of the negotiations said the likely cost-sharing deal was part of a political discussion of contentious issues, including France's campaign for nuclear hydrogen to be considered a renewable source, which Spain opposes.\nOne of them said that when the project was first conceived, France had an electricity surplus and was exporting to Spain, so Spain had agreed to pay part of the costs on the French side, but now the tables have turned.\nSpanish sources said the go-ahead would likely mean that France, whose nuclear power industry has been beset by problems, finally agreed to pay more.\nThe interconnection, that had been slated to be built by the power grid operators RTE of France and Spain's REE by 2025 and is now likely to suffer delays, would allow the two countries to double their electricity exchange capacity to 5,000 megawatts, enough to provide power for 5 million homes.\n($1 = 0.9369 euros)\nReporting by Bel\u00e9n Carre\u00f1o in Madrid, Benjamin Mallet in Paris and Kate Abnett in Stockholm;

The group is dismayed by what it says is a modern Republican Party driven by its allegiance to Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\u201cThe Republican Party is broken. It\u2019s time for a resistance of the \u2018rationals\u2019 against the \u2018radicals,\u2019\u201d said Miles Taylor, one of the organizers.

They fear that could dent control over payments, banking and, ultimately, the supply of money.\nThe EU set out plans in September to create comprehensive rules for crypto-assets, including stress tests as well as capital and liquidity requirements, saying Facebook would have to adhere to them before launching its proposed stablecoin in the bloc.\nIn a legal opinion on the EU rules, the ECB said it should have the final word on whether a stablecoin should be allowed to launch in the euro zone without jeopardising its control over inflation or the safety of payments.\n\u201cWhere an asset-reference arrangement is tantamount to a payment system or scheme, the assessment of the potential threat to the conduct of monetary policy, and to the smooth operation\nof payment systems, should fall within the exclusive competence of the ECB,\u201d the ECB said in the opinion dated Feb 19.\nIt added the proposed EU rules should be changed to say that its opinion on the matter is binding for national authorities assessing applications to issue stablecoins.\nFacebook was originally planning to launch a stablecoin, named Libra, backed by a basket of official currencies, but it scaled down the project last year after a regulatory backlash. It now aims for a dollar-backed digital coin, named Diem.\nThe ECB said issuers of stablecoins should be subject to \u201crigorous liquidity requirements\u201d similar to those applied to money market funds, including significant cash reserves, to help them withstand large client outflows.\nCompanies selling tokens linked to several currencies \u201cshould at a minimum grant end-users a direct claim on the issuer or on the reserve assets and redemption rights\u201d, the ECB added.\nThe ECB is working on its own digital euro, hoping to launch it within the next four years.

And yet every night, she waits until 4.17 am in the morning, the exact time that the disaster hit, to try to go to sleep.\n\"I keep thinking another disaster will strike at that time and just wait for it to pass,\" said Gul, 28, who managed to run out of her family house with her mother moments before the walls of her house collapsed during the tremors.\nAfter reaching the street barefoot, Gul saw the dead bodies of neighbours killed by falling concrete. She remembers the screams of people trapped in collapsed buildings.\nGul said the horror had put a heavy toll on the mental health of survivors who \"lost everything\" in the city of Antakya, which was devastated by the quake. She wants to one day seek professional help to address the trauma, but for now establishing a new life for herself and her family is the only priority.\nThe 7.8 earthquake magnitude earthquake, the most deadly in modern Turkey's history, will have a deep psychological impact, experts and officials say. More than 44,300 people died in the country and over 1.5 million were left homeless in freezing conditions. Millions have lost family members, jobs, life savings and their hopes for the future.\nCHILDREN AT RISK\nExperts fear children will be hardest hit. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) said many of the more than 5.4 million children who live across the quake zone were at risk of developing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"We know how important learning and routine is for children and their recovery,\" UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Afshan Khan said, after a visit to Turkey.\n\"They need to be able to resume their education, and they urgently need psychosocial support to help deal with the trauma they have experienced.\"\nAt a large camp for displaced people next to Hatay Stadium on the outskirts of Antakya, psychosocial support teams have set up small play areas and pitched tents filled with toys. Children sat on multicolored chairs in front of a large portable screen that played cartoons. Some children played hopscotch.\nMehmet Sari, a government psychosocial support worker, said he and others in his team have picked up signs of trauma in kids. \"We see that some children can't sleep, others can't eat, others have flashbacks and wet their beds,\" he told Reuters.\nThey need long-term support to recover from trauma, he said.\nTurkey's Ministry of Family and Social Services said it has dispatched more than 3,700 social workers to support the survivors across the quake zone.\nVolunteers with Izmir-based group Sokak Sanatlari Atolyesi dress in Superman and clown costumes and run activities for children living in tents at a shelter in Hatay province.\nBut a large 6.4 magnitude earthquake last Monday shattered efforts to give the children some feeling of normalcy amid weeks of terrifying after shocks.\nA video provided by Erdal Coban, one of the volunteers and the art director of the Sokak Atolyesi, shows the children's cheers and singing turn to screaming.\n\"Stay calm,\" one yelled as another held onto a toddler she was carrying.\n\"CONSTANT, CHRONIC STRESS\"\nTurkish people had already been under significant pressure, said Ayse Bilge Selcuk, psychologist and a professor at MEF University, due to rising poverty and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the earthquake has taken it to the next level.\n\"The stress is chronic and constant and it is now beyond a level that we can cope with,\" Selcuk said. \"For this nation to get back on its feet, we need to find that strength within us and that starts with our psychology,\" she added.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to rebuild homes within a year but it will still be many months before thousands can leave tents or shipping containers and daily queues for food and move into permanent housing, key to gaining the sense of normalcy and safety they lost.\nPeople look numb, likely a defense mechanism to deal with insurmountable stress, according to Selcuk. Anxiety, helplessness and depression are likely to be common and young people could feel a sense of rage.\nRebuilding efforts should include mental health, Selcuk said, urging the government to provide funding for trained psychologists to be sent to the quake zone and stay there. \"Sustainability is key. We shouldn't withdraw our attention three months later,\" she said.\n(This story has been refiled to correct the name of the university in paragraph 19)\nReporting by Humeyra Pamuk and Timour Azhari; Additional reporting by Birsen Altayli in Istanbul Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Frank Jack Daniel", "article_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/after-turkeys-earthquake-grave-mental-health-toll-looms-2023-02-27/", "article_date_publish": "2023-02-27 10:32:28", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2023-02-28 21:04:44+00:00", "generated_questions": "```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"0\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What will be the estimated number of children at risk of developing mental health issues in the earthquake zone in Turkey, according to UNICEF, by March 2023?\",\n    \"background\": \"The earthquake in Turkey has caused significant mental health concerns, particularly for children.\",\n    \"options\": [\"More than 3 million\", \"More than 4 million\", \"More than 5.4 million\", \"More than 6 million\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"1\",\n    \"question_title\": \"Which organization has dispatched psychosocial support teams to help children in the earthquake zone in Turkey, as of February 2023?\",\n    \"background\": \"Psychosocial support is being provided to children affected by the earthquake in Turkey.\",\n    \"options\": [\"UNICEF\", \"Red Cross\", \"Doctors Without Borders\", \"Turkish Ministry of Family and Social Services\"],\n    \"answer\": 3\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"2\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What is the primary reason children in the earthquake zone are at risk of mental health issues, according to experts, by March 2023?\",\n    \"background\": \"Children in the earthquake zone are experiencing significant trauma.\",\n    \"options\": [\"Lack of food\", \"Loss of family members\", \"Disruption of education\", \"Exposure to violence\"],\n    \"answer\": 1\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"3\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What is the magnitude of the aftershock earthquake that disrupted efforts to provide normalcy to children in Hatay province, as reported in February 2023?\",\n    \"background\": \"Aftershocks have further traumatized children in the earthquake zone.\",\n    \"options\": [\"5.4 magnitude\", \"6.0 magnitude\", \"6.4 magnitude\", \"7.0 magnitude\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"question_id\": \"4\",\n    \"question_title\": \"What is the estimated number of social workers dispatched by the Turkish government to support earthquake survivors, as of February 2023?\",\n    \"background\": \"The Turkish government is providing support to earthquake survivors.\",\n    \"options\": [\"More than 1,000\", \"More than 2,000\", \"More than 3,700\", \"More than 5,000\"],\n    \"answer\": 2\n}\n```\n<think>\nquestion 0 pros and cons based on guidelines and forecastability\n- Pros: The question is direct and precise, with a clear resolution date and source (UNICEF by March 2023).
