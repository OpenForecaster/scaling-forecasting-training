Experts say it could be both \u2014 or neither.", "article_maintext": "Turkey has decided to officially bid to join BRICS, a grouping of some of the world's emerging economies, originally comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2014 but largely dominated by Moscow and Beijing.\nOmer Celik, spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), confirmed Turkey's application and said the request was \"pending.\"\n\"Our president has already expressed multiple times that we wish to become a member of BRICS,\" he said in early September. \"Our request in this matter is clear, and the process is proceeding within this framework.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed Turkey's aspiration, according to Turkish media reports, and said that he will \"fully support\" Turkey's inclusion in the gathering.\nIf Turkey indeed becomes a member of BRICS, often described as a counterbalance to a Western-led global order, it could move further away from joining the European Union (EU) \u2014 and from deriving benefits of the 27-member bloc's single market.\nEU expects candidates to share bloc's values\nTurkey has the right to decide on its own international partnerships, the EU, however, expects candidate country to support EU values, according to Peter Stano, a spokesperson of the EU's diplomatic service.\n\"We expect all EU candidate countries to support EU values firmly and unequivocally, to respect obligations deriving from relevant trade agreements, and align with the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy,\" Stano told DW.\n\"These are significant signals of shared values and interests, and of countries' strategic orientation,\" he added.\nSome see Turkey's aim to join the BRICS group as a reaction to its lagging progress in EU accession talks.\nIn an annual report last year, European parliamentarians concluded that Turkey's \"alignment rate with the EU's Common foreign and security policy has slipped to an all-time low of 7%, making it by far the lowest of all enlargement countries.\"\nNacho Sanchez Amor, a parliamentarian with the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, said Turkey's path to the EU is through reforms.\n\"We have recently seen a renewed interest from the Turkish government in reviving the EU accession process,\" he noted in the 2023 statement. \"This will not happen because of geopolitical bargaining, but only when the Turkish authorities show real interest in stopping the continuing backsliding in fundamental freedoms and rule of law in the country.\"\nTurkey's accession process started in 2005, but ground to a standstill in 2018 over several issues, including EU concerns on curbs on media freedom, executive control over the judiciary and insufficient civilian oversight of the Turkish security forces.\nEying BRICS a sign of Turkish frustration with EU?\nOzgur Unluhisarcikli, a Turkey expert at the German Marshall Fund (GMF), added that Turkey's interest in BRICS is a manifestation of its frustration with the EU.\nTurkey is not only cross with the EU over stalling its accession process but also for not moving forward on modernization of the customs or the trade agreement, nor on a roadmap for visa liberalization, which could clear the way for Turkey's citizens totravel visa-free to European countries.\nThe BRICS group has doubled in size since it was formed 15 years ago. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have become members and the group has attracted applications from nearly 20 other countries, including Turkey.\nMembers do not strive to form a cohesive group with a common security or foreign policy. Instead, its members aim to cooperate on trade and economic expansion and provide what they see as a political counterbalance to international institutions dominated by the United States and Europe.\nStill potential for Turkish BRICS plan to backfire\nTurkish experts said Erdogan's overtures toward joining BRICS could be to gain leverage in Turkey's EU accession bid.\nAsli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the Brookings Institute who specialized in Turkey, said that Turkey's EU accession process \"has long been in a coma,\" and Turkey's policymakers are either trying to revive it or feel they have nothing to lose by joining BRICS.\nEuropeans have effectively frozen Turkey's accession process and are about to kick Turkey out from the enlargement agenda altogether while the Balkans have moved ahead,'' she told DW. \"I think Turkey's decisionmakers are not looking at BRICS as something that diminishes Turkey's importance but enhances it in a way that makes the West jealous, gives Turkey a greater chance of getting their attention.\"\nUnluhisarcikli pointed out the strategy could backfire as Turkey's entry into BRICS could make EU nations suspicious of Turkey.\n\"If Turkey were to become a member of BRICS its credibility or reliability within the transatlantic alliance would further decline,\" he told DW,\nTurkey: A mistrusted, necessary ally\nTurkish foreign and security policy decisions have already tarnished the country's image in Western capitals.\nTurkey has refused to back sanctions against Russia, and instead become a top buyer of Russian crude oil. Turkey also supports Hamas, the militant, Islamist, Palestinian group that carried out terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 and which is classified as a terrorist organization by the European Union as well as the United States, Germany and several other countries.\nThe United States and other NATO allies were irate over Turkey's purchase of S400 surface-to-air missile defense systems from Russia in 2017 and again in 2022 when Turkey held up Swedish and Finnish membership in NATO by two years before eventually giving up its opposition this year.\nHowever, Turkey's strategic location between the west and east makes it critical for NATO and US missions in the region, and the country inked an EU-sought agreement in 2016 allowing for the return of some irregular migrants who reach the bloc from Turkey.\nDespite the country's role in these international crises, the mistrust between Turkey and its allies shows no signs of abating. A German Marshall Fund survey on Turkey's relations with Western allies said that \"T\u00fcrkiye is the least reliable partner nation, according to the respondents in every country where the survey was conducted. At the same time, Turkish respondents were the least likely to find other allies reliable.''\nTurkish experts said that there was some sense in balancing the foreign policy of a country that straddles the west and the east.\n\"There is no doubt that relations with the EU are infinitely more important, but Erdogan really believes he can play off the West against the non-Western nations,\" Aydintasbas added.\nAlexandra von Nahmen contributed to this article.\nEdited by: Sean M.

These Indians had illegally entered the United States over the years and came from different Indian states.\nDeportation is a sensitive topic in India, and the event has led to a surge in misinformation online. DW Fact check analyzed some of the viral claims.\nHandcuffed and shackled Indians deported on a plane?\nClaim: \"This is the scene of the flight of migrant Indians who have been deported from the \"land of free\". They are handcuffed and have chains in their legs. \u2026\" wrotea Facebook user (archived here), posting a picture of handcuffed people sitting in a plane.\nDW Fact check: False\nThe picture does not show Indian migrants deported from the US. It is an Associated Press image from January 30 (archived here), depicting people waiting in El Paso, Texas, to be deported to Guatemala. They are, indeed, wearing face masks and have shackles on their hands and feet but the image is unrelated to the newly deported Indians.\nThough news agencies have released pictures of the plane landing at Amritsar airport, it is unclear under what conditions the Indians boarded the flight or what facilities they were provided with during the long journey. No images have been published so far, from inside the plane.\nThis is not the only misleading image of Indians being deported by the US. Another misleading post (archived here) in Hindi on Facebook claims: \"An American C-17 plane has departed with such people on board. This flight will arrive in India within the next 24 hours.\"\nThis is incorrect. The picture is also older, and from January 23, when the first deportation flight departed from Tucson International Airport to Guatemala. The imagewas provided by the US Air Force and circulated by various picture agencies such as Picture Alliance.\nExaggerated number of deportations shared online\nClaim: This picture circulating on social media (archived here) claims to show Indians who have been deported from the US recently. A user posted it on X, formerly Twitter and wrote: \"The first batch of illegal Indian immigrants has been deported from the USA by a C-17 Globemaster III military aircraft.\" It further added, \"Their American Dream is ended now.\"\nDW Fact check: False\nThe picture is old and not related to the recent deportation of Indians by the Trump administration. It was taken in late December 2023 in Mumbai, when hundreds of Indians were sent back from Paris after being suspected of human trafficking. They were flying on a chartered flight to Nicaragua, a Latin American country.\nBut there are not only fake images circulating online about the deportation of Indians from the US. The number of Indians being deported is causing discussion and confusion and leading to false information.\nA viral post on X claims that the US and Canada have approved a plan to deport 1.2 million illegal Indian immigrants (archived here). However, this number is incorrect.\nIndia and the US have been negotiating deportations for a long time. Last year, the US identified nearly 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, according to an exclusive Bloomberg report.\nMore than 1,100 Indians attempting to enter the US illegally were repatriated between 2023 and 2024. This occurred during President Joe Biden's tenure before Trump took office. There is no official figure for undocumented Indians living in the US, but a Pew Research Center reportestimates the number to be over 725,000, making them the third-largest group of undocumented migrants after Mexicans and Salvadorans.\nVideo of Indians boarding a plane?\nClaim: A videoposted on Instagram claims that Indian deportees were in pain while boarding the plane. The post in Hindi states: \"Masks on their faces, hands and feet in shackles. Indians were deported mercilessly from the US.\"\nDW Fact check: False\nThe video does not show Indians being deported but again one of the first deportation flights from mid-January. The footage originates from a videoreleased by the US Department of Defense (DoD) on January 27. The US Customs and Border Protection agents were seen guiding chained and handcuffed individuals onto a military aircraft in footage dated January 23, according to the DoD. The handout did not specify the destination of this flight.\nDeporting illegal immigrants from the US was a key promise in Trump's election campaign. However, the Indian government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration to avoid a trade conflict, according to Bloomberg.\nIndia also reportedly wants to protect its legal immigrants in the US.

Here's everything you need to know about the virus.", "article_maintext": "Alaskapox is an orthopoxvirus related to smallpox, cowpox and mpox (initially known as \"monkeypox\"). Infections have so far only occurred in the US state of Alaska.\nThere have only been seven recorded cases in humans since the first one was reported in 2015.\nPatients infected with Alaskapox report one or more skin lesions similar to spider or insect bites. Other symptoms include swollen lymph nodes and joint or muscle pain that usually clears up in a few weeks.\nBefore the patient who died in January, all other cases of Alaskapox were mild and did not require hospitalization.\nHow is the virus transmitted?\nResearchers believe the virus could be zoonotic, meaning it can transfer from animals to humans.\nAlaska health authorities reported that Alaskapox cases were prevalent in 2020 and 2021 in two species of small mammals \u2015 red-backed voles and shrews \u2015 in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, where most of the human cases were identified.\nHow exactly the virus made the jump from animal to human is still unclear. Patients could have received the virus from pets that came in contact with infected voles or shrews \u2015 that's what may have happened in the case of the patient who died.\nWhile direct human-to-human has not been observed, experts warn other orthopoxviruses can spread by direct contact with skin lesions and advise people with skin lesions potentially caused by Alaskapox to keep the affected area covered with a bandage.\nWhat do we know about the Alaskapox death?\nThe only person known to have died from the virus so far was a man from Alaska. Health officials described the man as \"elderly\" but didn't give an exact age.\nHe lived on the remote Kenai Peninsula that juts into the Gulf of Alaska off the state's southern coast. The peninsula is more than 483 kilometers (300 miles) from Alaska's Fairbanks area, where the six other cases occurred.\nHealth officials said this indicates the virus has spread to humans and animals outside the Fairbanks area.\nThe man was taking immunosuppressant drugs as part of his cancer treatment \u2015 \"the patient's immunocompromised status likely contributed to illness severity,\" Alaska's Department of Health stated in a bulletin on the case.\nIn September 2023, the man discovered a red papule in his right armpit. In November, he was hospitalized with fatigue, pain and reduced mobility in his right arm. Doctors discovered four other lesions across his body.\nTests revealed he had Alaskapox, and \"he later exhibited delayed wound healing, malnutrition, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure,\" according to the Alaska Department of Health.\nThe patient died in January 2024.\nThe man had lived alone and hadn't traveled before he became infected. Reports suggest he had been caring for a stray cat that regularly hunted small mammals and would scratch him frequently.\nIt is possible that the cat had come in contact with an infected vole or other small mammal and then transmitted Alaskapox to the man.\nWhat should you do if you think you have Alaskapox?\nSee a doctor if you think you may have contracted the virus.\nAvoid touching any lesions on your body and cover them with a bandage to avoid possible transmission.\nThe Alaska Department of Health recommends that people who might have Alaskapox \"practice good hand hygiene, avoid sharing cloth that might have been in contact with lesions, and launder clothing and linens separately from other household items.\"\nEdited by: Fred Schwaller", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/alaskapox-first-known-death-from-the-virus/a-68255944", "article_date_publish": "2024-02-14 14:34:04", "article_date_modify": null, "article_date_download": "2024-02-14 15:05:17+00:00", "generated_questions": "<analysis>\n<q1>\n<question_title>\nNo leakage found.\n</question_title>\n<background>\nLeakage found -- The background mentions \"seven recorded human cases,\" which indirectly reveals the answer (7) for the question about 2024 cases.\nReplacement -- Alaskapox is an orthopoxvirus related to smallpox, cowpox, and mpox, with infections so far only occurring in Alaska.

{"article_title": "German election: Climate and environment take a back seat", "article_description": "Germany has expanded wind and solar energy but failed to cut back on fossil fuel use in the transport sector. Environmental issues did not feature prominently the election campaign \u2014 unlike the last time around.", "article_maintext": "When the coalition government comprising the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) emerged after the last German federal election in the fall of 2021, incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) did not object to being called the \"Climate Chancellor.\" That was no surprise: the climate crisis had been a top issue during the election campaign.\nThe new government made the fight against climate change a task for the economy ministry and appointed Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck from the Greens as its head.\nThree and a half years later, campaign speeches barely mention climate protection. The dominant issues are how to curb irregular immigration and how to boost Germany's sluggish economy.\nSkeptical view of renewable energy\nThe head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz \u2014 who, according to the polls, is most likely to become the next German chancellor \u2014 has often said that Germany's approximately 29,000 electricity-generating wind turbines are a thorn in his side.\nIn November 2024, Merz told public broadcaster ZDF, \"I even believe that if we do things right, we can one day dismantle the wind turbines again \u2014 because they are ugly.\"\nThe CDU/CSU bloc believes in nuclear fusion as an energy source, although technological development in this field has stagnated for decades. Last year, electricity generation from renewable sources such as solar and wind accounted for around 56% of German energy production.\nMerz, however, also wants to revive nuclear power plants, the last of which went offline in 2023. The country's goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 65% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, is not part of the CDU/CSU's plans.\n\"The fact that the escalating climate crisis is not among the parties' top three issues in this election campaign is incomprehensible and irresponsible,\" Martin Kaiser, a climate expert with the environmental organization Greenpeace, told DW. \"Because right now, we need a consistent and socially-oriented climate policy.\"\nOil and gas from the US\nRecently, the environmental group World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) was appalled when German Chancellor Scholz expressed approval of importing oil and liquefied gas from the US in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt Scholz, arguing that increasing imports would lower energy prices.\nHowever, Heike Vesper, one of the managing directors of WWF Germany, said, \"More oil and gas on the world market would only mean one thing: fueling the climate crisis. The consequences would be damage costing billions \u2014 and an unstable economy.\"\nClimate protection remains one of the Greens' central concerns.\n\"I find it negligent that the other parties are now arguing against climate protection,\" Environment Minister Steffi Lemke of the Greens told DW. \"We know that we need climate protection and adaptation to climate change.\"\nClimate policy setbacks\nKaiser, the Greenpeace expert, believes the climate balance of the now defunct German government coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP is sobering. He said that the response to Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine and to the Constitutional Court's ruling that led to a cut in the budget massively damaged confidence especially in the government's climate policies.\nIn November 2023, the court ruled that the government was not allowed to use around \u20ac60 billion ($62 billion) of funds it had earmarked for climate protection. That fund had originally been allocated to combatting the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the court ruled that reallocating the funds for a different purpose was not possible.\nIn response to that ruling, the government cut, among other things, a purchase premium for electric cars, which led sales to fall.\nIn 2023, Economy Minister Habeck's plans for a new law to phase out fossil fuel heating systems were leaked. It stipulated that starting in 2024, heating systems in new buildings should be powered by renewable energies. This law was debated passionately for months by the government and the public, and was eventually adopted with substantial amendments mitigating the cost on individual households. Habeck and his Green Party saw their approval ratings fall.\nKaiser added that the FDP-led ministries of Transport and Construction also failed to develop measures to reduce CO2 emissions. He said that their partners from the SPD and Greens let them get away with it, fearing that otherwise, the coalition may break apart.\nIn the election campaign before the February 23 vote, climate protection has taken a back seat despite frequent reports of storms and flood disasters linked to climate change and the rapid rise in temperatures and sea levels worldwide.\n\"Whenever the next extreme weather event occurs \u2014 the next flood in Bavaria, for example \u2014 then we will again realize that it is all happening very close to home,\" Lisa Badum, a climate expert for the Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, pointed out.\n\"When we look at the international stage and see that Donald Trump has withdrawn from the UN climate agreement \u2014 it is ever more important that Europe moves forward.
