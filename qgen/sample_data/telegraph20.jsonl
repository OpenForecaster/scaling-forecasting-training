A total of \u00a382m has gone to just one law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills.\nAt the same time thousands of sub-postmasters are yet to receive the compensation they are owed and less than one third of the \u00a31.8bn allocated has so far been paid out due to an arduous claims process, said Liam Byrne, chairman of the Committee.\nHe said: \u201cYears on from the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, thousands of Post Office Horizon victims still don\u2019t have the redress to which they\u2019re entitled for the shatter and ruin of their lives.\n\u201cOurs is a nation that believes in fair play and the rule of law. Yet victims told us that seeking the redress to which they are entitled is akin to a second trial. Payments are so slow that people are dying before they get justice.\n\u201cBut the lawyers are walking away with millions. This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\nThe MPs on the Business and Trade Committee called for the Government to take over the handling of all compensation schemes instead of leaving some of them in the hands of the Post Office.\nThey also demanded a simpler and quicker system, criticising \u201cthe gold-plated legalistic process\u201d used currently which places an enormous administrative burden on victims.\nThe committee said: \u201cSwift action must be taken to deal with the thousands of claimants who still have not been given the redress that is owed to them. Sub-postmasters do not want Post Office Ltd to deal with redress and neither does Post Office Ltd itself.\n\u201cPost Office Ltd should not be deciding on what financial redress is owed to victims of its own scandal. The Government must finish the job in hand and remove Post Office Ltd from the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.\u201d\nThe committee also said hard deadlines should be imposed to pay claims, with extra compensation given to victims if these are missed.\nMr Byrne said: \u201cThe new Government has made important improvements. Payments are faster and the redress scheme is at last fully funded with more money.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t go on like this. Justice delayed is justice denied. So today, we\u2019re setting out a practical, common-sense plan to reboot the redress system.\n\u201cVictims should have upfront legal advice to help make sure they get what\u2019s fair. We need hard deadlines for government lawyers to approve the claims with financial penalties for taking too long. Crucially, we need the Post Office, which caused this scandal in the first place, taken out of the picture.\u201d\nThe Post Office said much of the legal bill was incurred in setting up the compensation schemes.\nA spokesman said: \u201cWorking alongside government, we are focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible. The Government\u2019s introduction of fixed-sum options without the need for postmasters to submit formal claims has helped greatly in accelerating settlements.\n\u201cOur spend with external law firms is kept under constant review with a significant portion having been spent on establishing the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and Overturned Convictions redress process, thus enabling us to pay redress to victims of the scandal.\n\u201cOur Chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the Government and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter.\u201d\nOther schemes are run by the Government. They are the group litigation scheme, which as of November had only fully paid out 47pc of claims, and the convictions redress scheme, which is still struggling to contact several dozen individuals whose convictions have been quashed.\nA government spokesman said: \u201cSince entering government, we have worked tirelessly to speed up the process of providing the victims of the Horizon Scandal with full and fair redress including by launching the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme earlier this year.\n\u201cWe are settling claims at a faster rate than ever before with the amount of redress paid doubling since July, with almost \u00a3500m being paid to over 3,300 claimants as of the end of November. We will respond to the Committee\u2019s report in due course.\u201d\nHerbert Smith Freehills said it has \u201cimmense sympathy\u201d for the victims.\nA spokesman said: \u201cHerbert Smith Freehills\u2019 work has been complex and wide-ranging, involving hundreds of our staff over several years.\n\u201cWe are confident that our fee levels are in line with norms for highly complex matters such as this.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Post Office accused of wasting \u00a3136m on Horizon lawyers", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/post-office-accused-wasting-136m-horizon-lawyers/", "id": "46824ae656f945386f32e0c4a2d5b983aee4dacd95b43df2bb83a2e2dd1e5786"}

Remember when this World Cup winner was acclaimed as the defensive linchpin United needed?\nThat portrayal felt a distant memory on the evidence of United\u2019s first-half capitulation against Newcastle, with his lack of height and poor positioning crucial factors in both goals. On the one night he needed to summon some leadership, stepping up as captain in place of the suspended Bruno Fernandes, he was as lily-livered as the rest. Despite revelling in a reputation as \u201cthe butcher\u201d, the moniker he brought with him from Ajax, he left his team ripe for a filleting.\nWhile United\u2019s torpor has become a tailspin, the question is who on the pitch has the gumption to stop it. Fernandes? Too reckless. Mart\u00ednez? Too error-prone. Rasmus Hojlund? Too toothless.\nThere is the awkward question, too, of how much these players truly care about the club\u2019s desperate predicament. Take Casemiro, for example. The Brazilian is emblematic of the worst United side in living memory, his CV decorated with five Champions League titles but his body language suggesting he regards his latest club as a form of lucrative semi-retirement.\nAs soon as he is spared international duty, he disappears to Disneyland. In defence or midfield, he has proved similarly ineffectual, embarrassing himself in the Newcastle defeat with a shot that almost sprang a fresh leak in Old Trafford\u2019s rickety roof.\nIn a situation as parlous as this, players are judged by their character, by whether they strain every sinew in pursuit of every loose ball. United fans look in vain for anybody who fits the description.\nAmorim is forced to start with Hojlund \u2013 absurdly overpriced on his five-year, \u00a372 million deal \u2013 only to castigate the Dane after seven minutes when he neglects to push up high enough. And when he seeks a breakthrough at 2-0 down, the manager must turn to Antony, a diagram of indolence who has not scored this season. He could be forgiven for re-examining the prospectus on which he was brought to United. It should be impossible for an institution to spend \u00a31.8 billion on players in 11 years and produce a team so feeble.\nIt is surely no coincidence that the one player with a link to the Ferguson era is the one who still exhibits an elite perspective. Jonny Evans might no longer be the centre-back he was in his first United spell, when he won the league three times, but he still knows how to articulate the weight of expectation that accompanies the shirt. \u201cI have a long affiliation with this club, and the pressures that come with it,\u201d he said in October, as Ten Hag neared the brink. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of it, it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d\nThose without Evans\u2019 United pedigree struggle to muster the same emotion or allegiance. Whether it is an over-the-hill Casemiro or the pitiful Antony, a sense forms of individuals who are simply passing through.\nThe mediocrity has lasted so long that it is now blithely accepted. And in a scenario where relegation looms, that is a major problem, with a side so accustomed to ordinariness that they lose the heart to aspire to anything else. It should be a clarion call, this plea by Amorim to \u201cfight\u201d. But he sounded as if he were blind to the bleakest reality of all \u2013 the fact that any fight in these players left long ago.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Manchester United\u2019s lily-livered players lack the fight Ruben Amorim demands", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2025/01/01/manchester-united-players-lack-fight-ruben-amorim-needs/", "id": "14f93baaf8fd2d3234f53204ea214a8360a2fc211358d005917bbb43f1a9867c"}

Van Dijk has been more positive, saying: \u201cI love the club, the club loves me.\u201d\nYet the noise will not matter to potential suitors for these stellar names. While January 1 is the date they can officially make offers of a pre-contract, due diligence will have been done in the first half of the season, testing whether there is interest in a move and ball-park terms of a contract.\nThere has been silence from Alexander-Arnold on his future, while Liverpool insist they have no wish for him to leave but Spanish newspaper Marca \u2013 known for its close relationship with Real \u2013 is confident the England international will join his close friend Jude Bellingham at the Bernabeu next season. Interestingly, the media outlet has also reported that Van Dijk is not a target, despite the injury to \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o.\nKevin De Bruyne is the other Premier League titan with his future unresolved. \u201cNothing yet,\u201d was the reply at the King Power Stadium when the Manchester City midfielder with 114 assists \u2013 the most among current players \u2013 was asked about his contract progress. De Bruyne, at 33, will still attract clubs in Saudi Arabia looking for a marquee signing, while the USA has also been an option.\nCity could still offer an extension, or a place in their stable of football clubs around the world, such is his standing at the club. It will not have been forgotten how he represented players through Covid in captains meetings rather than Spanish-speaking David Silva, nor his six Premier League titles and Champions League during the treble season.\nAre Bosman deals attractive?\nIt is coming up to 30 years since Jean-Marc Bosman sued the Belgian FA and Uefa for restraint of trade and the \u201cBosman Ruling\u201d came in. It allowed out-of-contract players to move clubs on a free transfer. At the time, the perception was power shifting to the players \u2013 they could run their contracts down and demand increased salaries as their next club would not be paying a transfer fee.\nThe current reality is that Bosmans are lucrative moves for the very best players in the world. With Real Madrid not paying a fee for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the summer when his deal at Paris St-Germain expired, they could pay a signing-on fee to the player \u2013 and a hefty one at \u00a3128 million \u2013 on top of salary and a percentage of image rights.\nBut below the level of Mbapp\u00e9 or Lionel Messi when his contract expired at Barcelona, it is a tough market particularly for older players. Intermediaries working in the Premier League are finding clubs less willing to invest huge free-agent contracts on players when they get to their mid-to-late 20s. The sweet-spot is early 20s for resale value, but lucrative contracts are not being dished out readily.\nJust look at last season. Anthony Martial, still a big name after nine seasons at Manchester United, ended up at AEK Athens in Greece. Adrien Rabiot was touted to all the major European clubs and eventually \u2013 in mid-September \u2013 agreed a deal with Marseille, whose aim this season is getting back into Europe. Mats Hummels has started six games at Roma, while Memphis Depay left Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and moved to Brazil to play for Corinthians.\nCan extensions be thrashed out?\nThe future of Salah, Van Dijk and De Bruyne could still be sorted out before their contracts expire, even with the congested fixture schedule for Premier League clubs. But it has certainly not been a season where clubs have looked to invest in tying down their players to new deals.\nSince the season has started, none of the major names in the Premier League renewed their terms. Morgan Rogers at Aston Villa got a new deal as his form improved and he pushed for an England place, but that has been just about it. Bruno Fernandes and Cole Palmer got their extensions done before the season started.\nCompare that to last season when Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker, Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, Martin Odegaard, Ollie Watkins and Evan Ferguson were just a few to get new deals during the season.\nSome of this is profit and sustainability (PSR) related. So do not be surprised if clubs do agree extensions for players but agree to back-date the salary and pay a lump sum in the summer. It means the figures will go on next season\u2019s books and result in a PSR win.\nWhy not buy now?\nPlayers with expiring contracts will have their value decreasing as they get closer to being a free agent. But generally speaking, interested clubs would rather wait until they are free transfers than pay a fee \u2013 which would still be a significant outlay \u2013 to get them six months earlier.\nUnited moving for Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez is a cautionary tale. The price for the Chile forward rose as Manchester City were also interested so he ended up in a swap deal to Old Trafford worth \u00a335 million, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan going in the other direction. S\u00e1nchez was loaned out the following year and eventually left on a free transfer.\nBest of the rest\nThere are some good deals for clubs looking at Bosmans, although not without risk. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was a hot property at Euro 2020, a back-up to Harry Kane and scoring goals at Everton. He has been hit by injury since and it needs a club to take a chance on him staying fit. Callum Wilson is in a similar position at Newcastle.\nTyrick Mitchell at Crystal Palace, overlooked by England despite their left-back troubles, looks a good prospect for those needing a full-back. Thomas Partey has started 21 games for Arsenal this season and would do a good job for another club. Out of foreign Bosmans, Jonathan Tah, an \u2018Invincible\u2019 with Bayer Leverkusen, will have offers. As will Lille striker Jonathan David. Alphonso Davies at Bayern Munich will join a major club if he moves.\nAngel Gomes broke into the England squad this season and has Premier League clubs looking to take him from Lille. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich\u2019s Leroy San\u00e9 has been linked with a return to England following his spell at Manchester City (2016-20).\nOne-year options\nThere are also a clutch of players with their contracts expiring but their clubs hold options to extend their deals by a year, eliminating the risk of losing them as a free agent. Tottenham captain Son Heung-min is, in theory, out of contract in the summer but his club will trigger his extension until 2026.\nAmad Diallo, one of the only shining lights in Ruben Amorim\u2019s reign at Manchester United, has his contract situation on the agenda at Old Trafford, with the club holding an option on his deal. Harry Maguire is in a similar situation at United and has performed well during the club\u2019s drop down the table.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "The next steps for players out of contract", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2025/01/01/trent-alexander-arnold-real-madrid-liverpool-transfer-news/", "id": "71eb1d3b7feb3ad449ee9ab7d80c385b79d54ea10af61dae005fcabd6570ccb9"}

The majority are not (for now, at least).\nOn average, Britain\u2019s private schools are raising fees by 13.7pc between the first and second school terms, when the policy takes effect.\nOur league table analyses the fees of over 1,200 fee-paying schools across Britain to see how those local to you have adapted to Labour\u2019s tax raid and, crucially, how this affects value for money through exam results.\nIndependent schools come in all shapes and sizes, with fees ranging from less than \u00a310,000 a year to in excess of \u00a360,000 for boarders at the most expensive institutions.\nHowever, one thing clear is that Labour\u2019s tax raid has vastly reduced the options for parents of more modest means.\nIn 2022-23, around 57pc of day fees were less than \u00a320,000 a year. Had fees increased with inflation, this figure would be 47pc today.\nHowever, the VAT hike, confirmed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Budget, means that today just 25pc of schools are below that threshold.\nWith fees costing more, parents will rightly be conscious about whether a school produces results worthy of the extra investment \u2013 and just because a school is expensive, it doesn\u2019t guarantee results.\nLast year, Cardiff Sixth Form College recorded the best results among fee-paying schools with over 95pc of exams being graded the top grades of A* or A at A-Level. However, with VAT forcing fees up to \u00a330,000 a year for its day pupils, the school will be out of reach for many.\nTelegraph Money analysis shows that, once you compare the top results relative to fees, lesser-known schools produce similarly impressive results \u2013 but at a fraction of the cost.\nAt the top of the fee-grade ratio for A-Level students is The Cathedral School in Wales, where fees are \u00a315,000 a year cheaper, but around 87pc of pupils are given the top grades at A-Levels and 64pc in GCSEs.\nWithington Girls\u2019 School in Manchester has around 90pc of GCSEs and 74pc of A-levels at A* or A, based on exams taken in 2023. But its fees are among the lowest in the country, at \u00a317,892 a year, even after the VAT change.\nHowever, for many parents the value of independent schools goes beyond academic achievements.\nWhile stalwarts of the public school system, such as Eton, Winchester, Tonbridge and Radley, produce excellent results, albeit at a steep price, they argue their higher fees contribute to multi-million pound capital projects and extracurricular activities.\nA spokesman from the Independent Schools Council said: \u201cIndependent schools take a much wider view of education than just exam results. Boarding schools in particular offer a wide range of activities outside the classroom and subjects inside the classroom.\u201d\nEton, for example, with fees of \u00a352,749 a year, recently opened a \u00a320m sports facility complete with an indoor pool, climbing wall, squash courts and fencing salle.\nOur league table also allows parents to find the fees most relevant to their child\u2019s current age \u2013 a first for a private school league table.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "How much will Labour cost you?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/private-school-labour-tax-raid-best-value/", "id": "c19eb877afa0e479ed57135fd8c4a84302e884a89e6611bbdb268cf63b719e0a"}

The opposite is true outside London, where parents often have little choice in where to educate their children, and even less now fees will rise by roughly \u00a32,000 a year.\nFew people would argue against spending more on state education, but the model the Government has chosen really is nonsensical, driven as it is by ideology, not economics, and the perverse effects of a manifesto promise not to raise income tax.\nIn a desperate bid to tease voters away from the Conservatives, Labour promised not to increase income tax \u2013 by far the biggest revenue raiser for the Treasury.\nIf it really wants to raise money from those with the \u201cbroadest shoulders\u201d it would be far more logical to, for instance, introduce another tax band for the very highest earners.

It has a Lowlander route between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a Highlander route to Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William.\nThe complaint tally was disclosed as fares on the service were increased by an inflation-busting 6.39 per cent on New Year\u2019s Day.\nSue Webber, the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 transport spokesman, said the figures suggested that the SNP\u2019s nationalisation was \u201cnot going to plan\u201d and \u201cpassengers were receiving a subpar service.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cJust like SNP-run ScotRail, it looks like they have messed up the nationalisation of the Caledonian Sleeper as well.

If the SNP want to get people out of their cars and onto public transport, then they must change their current approach.\u201d\nThe figures disclosed that 519 complaints were made between June 25 2023 and March 31 2024. A further 364 were lodged between April 1 2024 and Sept 14 this year. Of the total, 286 were made about the upkeep and repair of the train.\nBut Transport Scotland said: \u201cThe latest ORR passenger satisfaction results show that almost 90 per cent of Caledonian Sleeper guests were satisfied with their overall experience, with complaints (934) representing just 0.2 per cent of the almost 400,000 journeys made since the Caledonian Sleeper came into public sector control.\n\u201cIndeed, the latest ORR figures also show that complaints were down by 39 per cent in the 12-month reporting period (April 2023 to March 2024) in comparison to the 12 months prior \u2013 demonstrating a significant downward trend during public sector ownership.\u201d\nIt said that fewer than 3 per cent of services had been cancelled in the year to September and \u201cit is only right that passengers are compensated when disruption does occur\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Caledonian Sleeper receives nearly 1,000 complaints since SNP took over", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/caledonian-sleeper-1000-complaints-since-snp-took-over/", "id": "30590abb4d47a5c9c16981b31e5a156fbab9558ac05f53b31f6ffb1cfe07d542"}

It is very popular and the health benefits of completing it are significant.\n\u201cBut I worry that it has become a fashionable exercise for a lot of people. As a society, we need a wake-up call.\n\u201cIf you use Dry January as an excuse to drink to excess in December and February, and the rest of the year, then you\u2019re missing the point. Increasingly, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\nThe foundations of Dry January began in 2011 when Emily Robinson signed up for a half marathon in February and vowed to give up alcohol for the month before in preparation. She found she lost weight, slept better and gained more energy.\nWhen Ms Robinson joined Alcohol Change UK the following year, she suggested making Dry January an annual challenge to show people how much their health improved with a month off booze.\nAround 15.5 million people in the UK are expected to abstain from alcohol for 31 days, starting on Wednesday.\nHowever, new figures from Alcohol Change UK show that 26 per cent of men who drink said they had increased their intake in 2024 compared with 2023, while over a third (35 per cent) reported drinking above the low-risk guidelines of 14 units per week.\n\u2018Men heavily targeted to drink more\u2019\nDr Richard Piper, CEO at Alcohol Change UK, which is targeting male drinking this year, said: \u201cMen are heavily targeted by the alcohol industry to get us to drink more and more alcohol.\n\u201cThese companies spend millions putting booze front and centre of the things we love, from sporting events, gigs and \u2018lads nights out\u2019 to products in our favourite TV shows and films, or just via inescapable advertising we see as we go about our lives and on social media.\n\u201cYet, our research tells us that the tide is turning. With nearly one in three men planning a break from booze this January, it\u2019s clear they are making the link between what they drink and how it could be holding them back physically, mentally and in their day-to-day life.\u201d\nThe Priory Group warned that despite the good intentions, alcohol continued to kill at record levels, with more than 8,200 deaths in 2023 \u2013 a 42 per cent rise on 2019. It remains Britain\u2019s primary addiction, with 59 per cent of people seeking help at the Priory doing so for alcohol misuse.\n\u201cThe evidence shows that younger generations are reducing their alcohol intake, which is fantastic,\u201d added Dr Campbell.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m extremely worried about slightly older generations who grew up with harmful drinking habits and are drinking more than ever.\n\u201cI\u2019d implore everyone to embrace January as a time to reflect on their drinking habits, learn how to enjoy social events or to relax at home without alcohol, and carry those lessons learnt through the rest of the year. Alcohol is harmful and addictive, and sadly I see its consequences every day.\u201d\nExperts warn that recorded alcohol deaths were \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d because they did not include other drinking-related causes, such as intoxication resulting in fatal accidents, withdrawal seizures, heart attacks and strokes.\nAlcohol Change UK said it was important that people used their official Dry January tools, which include tracking and daily email coaching.

He was the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Britain\u2019s largest terrorist atrocity.\nA total of 270 people were killed when the Boeing 747 Clipper Maid of the Seas broke apart at 31,000ft as it flew from Heathrow to New York on Dec 21 1988.\nThe total included 11 people in the Dumfries and Galloway town of Lockerbie when the plane fell on their homes.\nBut the papers disclosed that no formal discussion about the controversial decision to free him was held by the Scottish Cabinet, which included Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon, the deputy first minister at the time.\nOnly sparse mentions of Megrahi are made in the minutes, including an acknowledgement by Kenny MacAskill, then the justice secretary, of an application by the Libyan government under Muammar Gaddafi for Megrahi\u2019s release.\nMegrahi was released on Aug 20 that year, hours after the announcement, and flown back to the Libyan capital Tripoli, where he received a hero\u2019s welcome from a crowd waving Scottish flags.\nThe scenes enraged people on both sides of the Atlantic, and the decision was condemned by Barack Obama and David Cameron, respectively the US president and UK prime minister at the time.\nScottish Cabinet papers from June that year reported: \u201cMr MacAskill said that on behalf of Scottish ministers, he was considering the formal application made by the Libyan government on May 5 2009 for the transfer of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi under the terms of the prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libya.\u201d\nIn a further meeting on Aug 18, two days before the public announcement of the decision to release the prisoner, the papers read: \u201cMr MacAskill said that he is expected to be in a position to make a statement in relation to the prisoner transfer application and the application for compassionate release in the near future.\u201d\nBut it took three years for Megrahi to die of the cancer, which it was claimed in 2009 could kill him within months.\nSpeaking recently on the anniversary of the bombing, Mr MacAskill said: \u201cWe do have rules for compassionate release which exist in Scotland.\n\u201cIt is dealt with by medical experts, the report came in that he had a prognosis of three months. It was on that basis I released him.\n\u201cHe was no threat to Scotland, he was a sick man, he lived considerably longer than the prognosis but I think there is [sic] reasons for that.\u201d\nIn May, Abu Agila Mas\u2019ud, another Libyan, will go on trial at a federal court in Washington, accused of making the bomb. Mr MacAskill said he believed that Mas\u2019ud would be convicted and that \u201che is the bomber\u201d.\nMegrahi did not have the skills for the bombing, but that did not mean he was not involved in some capacity, Mr MacAskill said.\nThe papers were published ahead of the broadcast of Lockerbie: A Search for Truth, a new Sky TV series that will be broadcast on Thursday, starring Colin Firth as Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the atrocity.\nDr Swire has long believed that Megrahi was wrongfully convicted of the bombing and that Libya was not behind the plot.\nHe has also insisted that the bombmaker was not Mas\u2019ud but a Jordanian \u201cwho was a double agent, or even a triple agent\u201d feeding intelligence both to his own country and the CIA, while making explosives for a militant group active in Palestine.\nOther bereaved families have expressed concern that the series and the casting of Oscar-winner Firth will \u201celevate Swire\u2019s story\u201d and propagate \u201cunproven conspiracy theories\u201d.\nHowever, Dr Swire has urged them to watch the series before making up their minds about who was behind the attack, while Sky TV has said victims\u2019 families were consulted and the series does not \u201cpresent a conclusion\u201d about who was culpable.\nMr MacAskill was approached for comment via the Alba Party, of which he is the acting leader following Mr Salmond\u2019s death in October.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Salmond and Sturgeon\u2019s Cabinet did not formally discuss releasing Lockerbie bomber", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/salmond-and-sturgeon-cabinet-did-not-discuss-bomber-release/", "id": "3edf2b2a665881abd11a0ee2ef3b9b2f50839329f8d05f59ccaf3de14bf15cdb"}

Quitting is good\u201d. Others contain a tally of how many cigarettes smoked and the total number of drags taken that day.\nAfter reading the message, participants can swipe it away or press a button to display information about accessing the NHS smoking cessation support pages online.\nChris Stone, of the University of Bristol\u2019s Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, said: \u201cFor those who are trying to give up, an initial lapse is a vulnerable moment, and risks leading to a full relapse to smoking.\n\u201cPeople like smartwatches. They like the idea of it delivering a message at the point that they smoke.\n\u201cTherefore, if we can identify this point of lapse, and deliver an intervention precisely at that point, we have an opportunity to improve the success of the quit attempt.\n\u201cIn carrying out this project, we have aimed to harness the latest thinking in intervention design, and deliver it in a convenient wearable package with minimal burden to the user and maximum engagement with behaviour change; and in doing so, make a difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nIn the study, published in JMIR Formative Research, the smartwatch app was tested on 18 people who were interested in quitting smoking.\nThey wore a TicWatch loaded with the custom app for two weeks, from the moment they woke up until they went to bed, when they were instructed to charge their device overnight.\nThe participants were also advised to remove the smartwatch while showering, swimming or performing any activities that might damage it, such as contact sports.\nAt the end of the two-week period, they sent back the watch and completed a survey consisting of 27 questions.\nIn total, 66 per cent of participants said it was acceptable to wear the smartwatch with the technology, while 61 per cent of those in the study said the content of messages was relevant to them.\nPositive feedback included people reporting that the app raised awareness of smoking, made them feel positive about quitting, made them stop and think, smoke slightly less and it provided constant encouragement.\nNegative responses were that repeated messages lost effectiveness, the message did not appear quickly enough, there was not enough variety of messages and some were vague.\n\u2018Biggest cause of cancer in UK\u2019\nAlizee Froguel, the prevention policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cSmoking is the biggest cause of cancer in the UK and stopping completely is the best thing you can do for your health.\n\u201cThis study shows that smartwatches could be a useful method to help people quit smoking, but more research is needed to understand how effective they are.\n\u201cThere are many tools available to help people quit, and getting support from your free local stop smoking service will give you the best chance of stopping successfully.\n\u201cTo help create a smoke-free future, the UK Government must ensure cessation services are sustainably funded and accessible for all.\u201d\nTo qualify for the study, participants needed to be aged between 18 and 70, and smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day with their right hand.\nPeople with any mobility issues affecting their right hand or arm, or those who used e-cigarettes or any form of nicotine replacement therapy during the study period, were excluded.\nThe researchers believe that their app is the first just-in-time intervention for preventing smoking relapse that runs entirely on a smartwatch and does not need to be paired with a smartphone.\nThey are calling for a longer-term effectiveness trial to be carried out as the next step, which could use a greater variety of messages.\nTheir work is part of the Smoking Cessation theme of the Cancer Research UK-funded Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Smartwatches could help smokers quit by sending alert when they pick up a cigarette", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/smartwatches-could-help-smokers-quit/", "id": "a44c0478431a3c58e736bcc6bff88b7896a9c081cd626d53587ed2f63707f8e6"}

For Sarah Burghard, it was Asda and the sight of Christmas crackers in October. \u201cI just felt overwhelmed by the inevitable consumerism of the season ahead. The thought of another Christmas season watching TV, eating and drinking too much felt like the road to an uninspiring 2025. I wanted something different\u201d. Within weeks Burghard had moved to Lombok in Indonesia, where she now lives the life of a digital nomad. \u201cI\u2019d fallen in love with the country on previous visits. And that day in Asda was the final straw \u2013 once I got the idea in my head to be there before Christmas, there was no looking back.\u201d\nHow many times have you vowed to do something radical \u2013 especially at this time of year \u2013 only to quietly drop that fervent resolution a few weeks later? In fact, 92 per cent of us will not follow through on a New Year\u2019s resolution. \u201cWe\u2019re hard-wired to feel wariness around change,\u201d says therapist and business psychologist Paula Gardner. \u201cFor our ancestors, moving to an unfamiliar part of the landscape would bring risks, vulnerability and uncertainty, whereas knowing your area and the people around gave you higher odds of survival.\u201d Research shows that one in three of us would avoid change altogether if we could.\nYou have to fight that \u201cBetter the devil you know\u201d urge if you want to bring about change in your own life: so take the following practical steps.\nMake an anti-bucket list\nIf you\u2019re still not 100 per cent sure what shape your big life change should take, start by establishing what you categorically do not want. This gives you clarity and helps you nail your values so you can plan for the future, says Sid Madge, author and founder of the Meee Programme who has worked for some of the world\u2019s largest companies \u2013 and in 2010 walked away from the corporate life in search of new meaning. \u201cYou may have got out of the habit of thinking about what you want, because of life\u2019s responsibilities and the pressure to do the things you think you \u2018should\u2019 do,\u201d he suggests.\nSo, ask yourself: \u201cWhat do I really NOT want in my life any more?\u201d Put all these things on your anti-bucket list. Work in an office full of stressy people? Mountaineering? Learn a language? Once you start eliminating the \u201cno\u2019s\u201d, the whole process becomes much more fertile and creative.\nMaybe commuting is on your anti-bucket list. So, what\u2019s the alternative? Working locally or working from home. The next step is to ask: \u201cWhat skills do I possess to enable me to do that?\u201d And now you\u2019re on a roll with planning for change.\nVisualise your changed life\nPicturing yourself living differently can make it more likely to become reality. \u201cIf you want to work abroad, for example, visualise what your day would be like,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cPicture yourself taking classes to learn the language, booking the accommodation and settling down to work with your laptop at a table on a sunny balcony. If you do some mental rehearsing, you\u2019re more likely to do it for real,\u201d she adds. This is why coaches create mood boards. \u201cIncluding visuals that represent the lifestyle you anticipate \u2013 the locations, the activities, the highlights \u2013 can serve as a constant visual reminder to help motivate you, build momentum and keep your eye on the bigger picture.\u201d\nGetting the end in mind before you start is a surefire method for success, says strategic business consultant Emma Mills-Sheffield. Especially if your goal is to lose weight. \u201cWanting to be the mother of the bride in a particular dress gives you a deadline. But you need to be intrinsically motivated too \u2013 how will I feel if I lose weight/get fit? Is it feeling stronger, healthier, more confident, with more energy to run after the kids? If I can visualise that, I can then work backwards from it and think: \u2018Right, so what will it take to get me there?\u2019\u201d\nDabble before deciding\nThe theory of Possible Selves suggests that there are multiple possibilities for us out there \u2013 you could write that novel, but equally, you could go for that promotion or go back to university part time. \u201cWe don\u2019t choose because it\u2019s frightening to commit, but what if you could just play with those ideas? Rather than setting a goal, you can experiment,\u201d says Gardner.\nSo, if you fancy becoming an aromatherapist, do a short course in aromatherapy to see what it actually entails. Read up on the subject and talk to practitioners, even ask if you can shadow them for the day. You may find you love it or realise it\u2019s not for you. \u201cWhen people set themselves big goals and don\u2019t achieve them there\u2019s the danger of the shame attached to not following through. But experimenting means you aren\u2019t fully committing, just trying it on for size,\u201d says Gardner. Dabbling can give you certainty that a particular new life plan is right for you, meaning you can move forwards with confidence.\nDo a budget\nMills-Sheffield says the financial planning stage is crucial, whatever your goal may be. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning on leaving an unhappy marriage, don\u2019t just pack a bag and leave. Have you done a financial review, and do you know what you can afford to do? If you can\u2019t leave just yet, is there something you can do to boost your finances, such as get a part-time job to build up some savings?\u201d\nIf you\u2019re planning on launching a business or becoming self-employed, skipping this step can be dangerous. Optimism and confidence may not cut it if you don\u2019t do your research and do a proper business plan. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), around 45 per cent of new businesses fail during their first five years, with lack of financial planning being a major cause. For Burghard, her new lifestyle is infinitely more affordable than her old one. \u201cLiving in Lombok costs a tenth of the price of living in Bristol. My lifestyle is so much better than in the UK, but my rent is just \u00a3170 a month.\u201d\nDo it incrementally\nMaking a radical change is of course risky, and not everyone is in a position to do so. But change can be incremental rather than total and immediate, says Madge. \u201cPeople try to change too much, and then they give up. Resolutions are hard to sustain. But you can use incremental change to gradually make a bigger one.\u201d\nFor Katherine and Skip Khangurra, 41 and 56, from Windsor, launching their business, Libra Fine Arts, has been done in a manageable way so they can still afford to pay the bills. \u201cAfter years of working in high-pressured jobs as aircraft dispatchers and the stress of clinging onto our jobs during the Covid pandemic, the move to launching our own business while remaining part-time in our jobs has given us peace of mind \u2013 and embracing a better work-life balance has been such a joy,\u201d says Katherine. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that feeling of someone else pulling the rug out from under my life when my job was on the line, so this gives me a sense of control while doing something I love.\u201d\nBe methodical\nFor Sandy Lancaster, 56, from Chiswick, a big career change was a huge leap of faith. \u201cI longed for a career that felt more aligned with my interests and passions. Retraining as a colour analyst and personal stylist, selling the family law firm and trusting in my ability to succeed independently has been one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d\nLancaster\u2019s career change was carefully thought through and planned. \u201cThe only way I could do it was methodically, first researching, then investing in training, then building my client base from scratch. I leveraged my corporate background to create my business plan and used the downtime during lockdowns to build my social media presence and network.\u201d\nResearch needs to be thorough if you want a realistic view of what\u2019s ahead. \u201cAt your research stage, do the \u2018boring bits\u2019\u201d, says Mills-Sheffield. \u201cSo, if your plan is to move to the seaside, go and spend a few weeks there in the winter and do the boring day-to-day tasks instead of only going when it\u2019s sunny and spending all day on the beach. Go when it\u2019s rainy and you\u2019ve got to do a big shop at the supermarket.\u201d\nMake connections\nBurghard took some essential steps to help pave the way for her Indonesian adventure. \u201cJoining a Facebook community group and posting for social and business connections, I met an estate agent who helped me find an apartment and a variety of really friendly expat and local women who gave me encouragement and information about working visas and areas to live.\u201d These connections have been key to her move being a success.\nFor Katherine Khangurra, making vital connections was a game-changer. \u201cAt first, we made a lot of mistakes, but we soon learnt from talking to people at craft fairs and asking questions. We made friends and useful connections. After a year of doing trade shows, we\u2019re now on sale in 30 shops in the UK.\u201d\nFind social support\n\u201cThe naysayers who question how you\u2019re going to earn your income if you quit your job think they\u2019re speaking from a well-meaning place, but often they\u2019re piling on the doubt because of not wanting things to change,\u201d says Gardner.\nBusiness psychologist Jess Baker says that negative vibes make our self-doubt kick in. \u201cAll it takes is for someone to ask an awkward question that pinpoints something we\u2019re not quite comfortable with about this life change, and we\u2019re in a self-critical tailspin.\u201d So find social support among people in a similar situation, with whom you can have a shared language and understanding.\n\u201cI threw myself into networking groups \u2013 places where I could connect with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and learn from others who were also carving out their own paths,\u201d says Lancaster. \u201cThese groups became my lifeline.\u201d Whatever your goal, accountability really helps, so find someone to help keep you on track and share the highs and lows with. \u201cWe try and do too much by ourselves, but if we have a running buddy to help us achieve fitness goals, it\u2019s incredibly motivating to have them to answer to, knowing we\u2019ll be in trouble if we bail on them,\u201d says Mills-Sheffield.\nMarina Gask is co-founder of Audreyonline.co.uk, the platform for entrepreneurial women", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Always talking about changing your life?

That is nearly 10 times higher than in 1998/1999.\nAnaemia caused by vitamin B12 or B9 (folate) deficiencies also led to 3,490 hospital admissions in 2023/24, up four-fold from the turn of the century.\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt is very concerning that cases of nutrition-related anaemia serious enough to warrant hospital admission have seen such a substantial increase over the past 25 years.\n\u201cThe near 10-fold rise in admissions for patients with a diagnosis of iron deficiency and a four-fold increase in folate deficiencies \u2013 primarily caused by a lack of nutrition in the diet \u2013 is particularly troubling.\n\u201cWhile treatable with supplements or dietary changes, it comes with the risk of complications \u2013 in children, iron deficiency can be detrimental to development and has been linked to poorer attainment at school.\u201d\nSymptoms of iron deficiency include being very pale, irritability, fatigue, increased heart rate, sore or swollen tongue, and enlarged spleen. The condition can cause heart failure if left untreated.\nOverall the NHS prescribed 804,936 courses of treatment for iron deficiency anaemia, up from 721,650 the year before.\nThe figures show there were also 2,630 admissions for B vitamin deficiency (other than folate), up 15 per cent on the previous year and more than triple levels in 1998/1999.\nSymptoms of vitamin B deficiency can vary but include fatigue, muscle problems, breathlessness, headaches, pale skin, vision problems and heart palpitations.\nThe NHS issued more than 260,000 treatments for vitamin B deficiency in 2023/2024, an increase of 11 per cent.\nThe data further showed 486 courses of treatment involved people with vitamin C deficiency, up from 338 the previous year, while 773 involved a lack of calcium, up from 758.\nProf Hawthorne said the link between overall health and nutrition is \u201cwell established\u201d and a \u201cpoor diet can increase a patient\u2019s risk of developing certain health conditions, while also exacerbating existing conditions\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cWe have seen fresh, healthier foods spike in price over the last few years, making a nutritious diet increasingly unaffordable for some, while \u2018fast foods\u2019 are cheap, are filling and easy to access, but are low in nutritious content.\n\u201cGPs are on the front line of this public health crisis, caring for patients who are experiencing the health consequences of growing deprivation.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that a developed nation like the UK should see an increase in the number of conditions that can be linked to poverty and poor nutrition and yet this is the reality.\u201d\nA recent survey of Royal College of GPs members found that 74 per cent have seen an increase in the number of presentations linked to poverty over the past year.\nResponding to the figures, a government spokesman said: \u201cLord Darzi\u2019s report laid bare the poor health of our nation, which is putting pressure on our NHS services.\n\u201cOur 10-year health plan will shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention and will include action to ensure people have access to a healthy and balanced diet.\n\u201cThrough the Plan for Change, we will fix the foundations of the country to ensure everyone lives healthier lives for longer.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "The vitamin deficiencies behind surge in hospital admissions", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/vitamin-deficiencies-surge-hospital-admission-poverty-nhs/", "id": "997b0d9ec0cbbd4b62b89a9ea54bfddc22a57ea31131ab92e8bb3324be62f112"}

His most successful gambit was in India, where a joint venture in 1981 with the state-backed Maruti company made Suzuki the first large-scale foreign investor in what had hitherto been a closed and somewhat backward domestic industry.\nMaruti Suzuki grew to be India\u2019s largest auto maker, with a dominant share of the affordable small car and commercial vehicle sector, despite rising competition from Tata and others. By 2007, the Indian government having gradually sold its stake, the venture was a wholly-owned Suzuki subsidiary; in recent years, half of Suzuki\u2019s global output of more than 3 million vehicles have been sold in India.\nMeanwhile, Osamu Suzuki bolstered his broader ambitions by securing alliances with General Motors in the US and Volkswagen of Germany, though both came to grief. GM acquired a stake in Suzuki which grew to 20 per cent but was sold off to raise cash as GM itself slid towards bankruptcy in 2009; Volkswagen came in as a replacement investor, but the relationship soured and was unwound in 2015.\nThe Suzuki company traced its origins to 1909, when Michio Suzuki, son of a cotton farmer, began manufacturing looms for the silk industry in the coastal town of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka province. As export demand for Japanese silk declined in the late 1930s, Suzuki began to develop a prototype small car \u2013 and in the postwar industrial recovery, the company turned to manufacturing the low-cost Suzulight model, powered by a 360cc two-stroke engine, and a range of motorcycles.\nMichio Suzuki was succeeded by his son-in-law and adopted son Shunzo, who in accordance with Japanese custom took the family surname to perpetuate the business. Likewise, Osamu Matsuda \u2013 born at Gero in Gifu prefecture on January 30 1930 \u2013 became Osamu Suzuki at the time of his arranged marriage to Shunzo\u2019s daughter Shoko and his entry into the company in 1958.\nAfter graduating in law from Chuo University in Tokyo, Osamu had first worked in a bank and reportedly harboured political ambitions. But he dedicated himself to the auto business and rose to be its president from 1978 to 2000, when he moved up to chairman.\nSuzuki was an autocratic and plain-spoken corporate chief: \u2018\u201cIf I were to listen to everybody, it would make things too slow,\u201d he wrote in his memoir I\u2019m a Small-Business Boss (2009). He was also famously frugal, cutting back on air-conditioning in his factories, shifting production capacity from Japan to lower-cost Thailand, and flying economy class himself.\nHis anointed successor was his own son-in-law, Hirotaka Ono, whom he publicly declared to be more able than his son Toshihiro. But Ono died of cancer aged 52 in 2007 and Osamu Suzuki took up the executive reins again the following year, when the company\u2019s profits were suffering from the global recession.\nInvestors became increasingly concerned at the lack of a succession plan, however, after the octogenarian Osamu declared his intention to stay in post \u201cuntil the day I die\u201d. He finally handed over to Toshihiro in 2016, having led a public apology following a scandal over discrepancies in the company\u2019s fuel and emissions testing.\nBut he continued as chairman until 2021 \u2013 declaring himself \u201cfull of life\u201d having played 47 rounds of golf in the preceding year, and \u201ceasily accessible for advice\u201d whenever needed. He is survived by his wife and their three children.\nOsamu Suzuki, born January 30 1930, died December 25 2024", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Osamu Suzuki turned his family firm into major manufacturer of cheap cars and motorbikes", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2025/01/01/osamu-suzuki-car-motorbike-india-japan-manufacturer/", "id": "d7e440b0bf8242da6d7da8447a6c1283d8ead8d302d80980878e6576711a042e"}

As such, I craved a little more jingle in my bells and was delighted to come across An Organ for the Sultan (Radio 3). The church organ is the background noise in my house during the Christmas period, as some radio or other burbles merrily away. Ben Cottam\u2019s programme allowed me to extend that lovely feeling by exploring the life of Thomas Dallam, who built the organ in King\u2019s College Chapel, Cambridge. It was perfect \u201cbetween week\u201d radio (I refuse to call it \u201cTwixmas\u201d).\nDallam, a favourite of Elizabeth I, was given an onerous task \u2013 to build an organ of such magnificence that it would entrance the most powerful man in the world, the leader of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Mehmed III, and entirely transform the international reputation of England and its crown. He also had to get the thing to Constantinople in one piece. Dallam, said one contributor, \u201cpulled out all the stops\u201d.\nIt was an irresistible tale, one of storms, pirates, bribery and a young Lancastrian who embraced the whole endeavour as if he was on a gap year. He climbed mountains when others told him not to, he downed wine from strangers when all else declined (\u201cBest wine I ever drank,\u201d he wrote in his diary), he fixed the waterlogged organ with old spoons. He seemed in constant fear of losing his head (literally). Once inside the Topkapi Palace, the scene was a riot of ritual and spectacle, involving mutes and dwarves and beautiful women. Dallam even became the first Westerner to get a peek of the sultan\u2019s harem.\nIt was a ripsnorting, swashbuckling adventure with a charismatic, charmingly reckless hero at its centre \u2013 you could draw a direct line from Dallam\u2019s diaries to Indiana Jones (ideal \u201cbetween week\u201d movies, incidentally) \u2013 and it is easy to see why the combination of ingenuity and pluck was something Britons took to heart. The sultan was bowled over too, and tried to keep Dallam, something Queen Elizabeth seemed to view as acceptable collateral damage for improved diplomatic relations and open trade routes. The only disappointment was that Dallam faked illness and a family to get home to, rather than escaping the palace in a feat of derring-do.\nSomeone on my wavelength this week was Pete Doherty, singer and guitarist with The Libertines, who appeared on Kirsty Young\u2019s always-interesting interview series Young Again (Radio 4). The conversation was excellent, gently probing and illuminating, but Doherty had no truck with the programme\u2019s central conceit, which is that the guests dispense words of wisdom\nto their younger selves.\nWhen Young pressed him on what he might say to the teenage Pete, Doherty was at a loss: \u201cI\u2019d tell myself who was going to win the Grand National\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an awful lot I could say.\u201d As someone refusing to engage with any kind of self-improvement until January, I was pleased with his stance. He did, however, have one bit of advice. \u201cGet some sleep,\u201d he said.

But I think it\u2019s a dream job, really, in terms of being able to do a portrait and sculpt, and do something in bronze.\n\u201cTo be able to do a commission which is such high profile \u2026 it\u2019s such a fantastic privilege.\u201d\nMs Marsh, from Sheffield, said the way a subject was portrayed was crucial.\nHer aim was to convey the King\u2019s \u201cthoughtful character\u201d, recognising that he is a deep thinking and spiritual monarch.\n\u201cI think for myself, my key sense is a thoughtfulness, that\u2019s what I wanted to put into the portrait,\u201d she said of her impression of the King. \u201cSo, a sense of thoughtful consideration in terms of expression, his thoughtful character.\u201d\nSam Starsmore, from Norfolk, a student on the building crafts programme, was tasked with carving the lettering on the plinth.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, now the Princess of Wales, was invited by her father-in-law in recognition of their shared interest in the arts and creative industries.\nAs the royal trio toured the site, which offers courses in craft and art forms from fashion and textiles to thatching and blacksmithing, the King\u2019s eye was immediately drawn to a snail shell sculpture created by students.\nThere, he met Ms Marsh, revealing that he was \u201cfascinated\u201d by the piece.\nThe King told her of the \u201cimportance of safeguarding traditional skills for future generations\u201d.\nShe has since been hailed as a \u201cfantastic example\u201d of the course\u2019s success.\nSustainable communities\nThe King\u2019s Foundation was founded when Charles was Prince of Wales in 1990. Known until recently as the Prince\u2019s Foundation, its aim was to promote sustainable communities through education, training, and regeneration of historic sites.\nWhen he stepped in to save Dumfries House for the nation in 2007, with a \u00a345 million rescue package, it became the charity\u2019s base, offering educational courses for almost 15,000 students a year, with a focus on traditional and heritage crafts.\nThe King spoke last year about the battle to maintain such \u201ctimeless skills\u201d, noting: \u201cThey are all rather disappearing.\u201d\nKristina Murrin, chief executive at the King\u2019s Foundation, said: \u201cTo celebrate the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s 35th anniversary in 2025, we felt it was fitting to install a permanent monument to His Majesty at our charity headquarters Dumfries House, to recognise his role as our royal founding president and his positive impact on the local community.\n\u201cMost importantly this new installation will showcase the talents of our students and alumni.\u201d\n\u2018Very proud\u2019\nMs Murrin added: \u201cWe are very proud of our graduate Lily, who has gone on to a successful career as a stone carver and sculptor.\n\u201cShe is perfectly suited to take on the job of creating this permanent reminder of our 35th anniversary.\n\u201cEqually to have Sam, a current student on our building craft programme, creating the plinth for such an important commission just shows the depth of talent in traditional skills in this country and how hopeful we should be for the future generation of master craftspeople.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "First picture of King Charles's official bust", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2025/01/01/revealed-first-picture-of-king-charles-official-bust/", "id": "cd5fc2648e6b2dd792bf265226a2f6bb1239252f9ad411cb7770ff0f21965add"}

The same goes for the Government\u2019s intended housebuilding boom, which if it happens at all will take some time to get going.\nIn the meantime, the economy has to contend with the damage done to confidence by the Government\u2019s tax raid on business and its package of enhanced workers\u2019 rights.\nThe increase in employers\u2019 National Insurance doesn\u2019t happen until April, but already firms are taking evasive action. Hiring is being slashed, investment plans are being shelved, and many companies will attempt to claw back the increase in costs through higher prices.\nThe international backdrop looks equally bad. The UK economy still tends to move in tandem with the other major economies of Europe, where the outlook is similarly grim.\nIf there is a recession, it will nevertheless largely be one of Labour\u2019s own making, an astonishingly inept outcome for a Government that came to power promising the most pro-business Treasury in history and the fastest rate of growth in the G7.\nInstead, the economy is grinding to a halt, raising the prospect of further growth-stifling tax rises to ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s fiscal rules. The Chancellor\u2019s promise of no more tax rises already looks hollow.\nJust as worrying, inflation is likely to prove stickier than many anticipate, fuelled by higher public sector pay awards, the increased minimum wage, the increase in National Insurance and Trump\u2019s threatened tariff war.\nThis may in turn frustrate the Bank of England\u2019s plans to bring down interest rates, notwithstanding the weakened economic outlook. Higher for longer will continue to be the order of the day.\nThe US Federal Reserve may similarly struggle to cut rates this year, but for rather different reasons. From the threatened tariff war to tax cuts and the mass deportation of immigrants, many of Donald Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary. Higher for longer US interest rates imply a stronger dollar, a weaker pound, and an even weaker euro, which will hit parity against the dollar as the European Central Bank slashes interest rates to support a struggling eurozone economy.\nDon\u2019t make the mistake many commentators made in 2016, at the start of Trump\u2019s first presidency, of assuming his policies doom America to economic catastrophe.\nTrump\u2019s deregulatory agenda alone is sufficient to keep the US economy booming for a while yet. Markets are admittedly already frothy, and valuations look stretched across the board. Rampant growth in largely unregulated private credit is as clear a warning sign as they come of financial excess. And Trump\u2019s promise to further deregulate crypto is an accident waiting to happen if ever there was one.\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump has got no convincing plan for dealing with the deficit, so investors will eventually begin to question the risk free nature of US Treasuries.\nYet all these threats are still some distance off, and I doubt they\u2019ll materialise this year.\nAt some stage markets will crash, but it needs a trigger, and it is for now hard to see what it might be. Most of the US indices will therefore end the year higher than their current values.\nWe have nonetheless almost certainly already seen \u201cpeak Musk\u201d. It is hard to have a conversation these days without some mention of this ubiquitous entrepreneurial dynamo.\nI don\u2019t see him falling out with Trump in some massive clash of egos, as many predict; he\u2019s got too much riding on keeping the president sweet to risk such a confrontation.\nBut the hype around the world\u2019s richest man is now so extreme that he can only really disappoint. Jealous of his success, his rivals in Silicon Valley and beyond are circling, desperate to undermine him.\nIt\u2019s possible that Peter Mandelson, Britain\u2019s new ambassador to Washington, may be able to negotiate a carve-out for the UK from Trump\u2019s universal tariff plan, but it is very unlikely that this would result in a fully-fledged free trade agreement, even if Trump were to propose one.\nTo sign such a deal would be a death blow for a UK agricultural sector already seething with anger over Labour\u2019s inheritance tax assault on family farms. Rightly or wrongly, Labour will continue to prioritise getting closer to Europe over increased economic ties with the US.\nBritain already enjoys a perfectly good trading relationship with the US, and it is not clear that the obligations of a deal largely dictated by American interests would much improve things.\nThis is a column about economics; geopolitics is not my field. Yet the two have become so intermingled in recent years that it is impossible to avoid some assessment of geopolitical events.\nTrump\u2019s re-election on a Make America Great Again, anti-globalist approach to international affairs has obviously turned previous calculations on their head. Yet I wouldn\u2019t bet on what must be the most widely stated prediction for 2025 \u2013 that he\u2019ll successfully impose some sort of shabby peace deal on Russia and Ukraine.\nUnder this scenario, a war-weary and economically crippled Russia would settle for the land already acquired while Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky would, with the threat of US military aid being withdrawn, have no option but to accept.\nThis view has become such common currency that it is now widely seen as inevitable. There is, however, many a slip, and I see no reason why Putin would accept such an outcome.\nAs for the nation of Oceania in George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four \u2013 which sustains its totalitarian regime via a state of permanent war with Eurasia or Eastasia \u2013 endless conflict in Ukraine has become part of Putin\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. For him, \u201cwar is peace\u201d \u2013 a way of keeping himself in power.\nThere\u2019s little sign of Russia\u2019s imminent economic collapse, or of Putin being toppled, which though much predicted in the West is more a case of wishful thinking than an outcome solidly grounded in probability.\nSo on that depressing note, here\u2019s wishing all who have got this far good health and a prosperous new year.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Recession warning signs are already flashing for Britain in 2025", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/recession-warning-signs-already-flashing-britain-2025/", "id": "9fb0bea5e4f9076666fc6c53ee8367991d67780a26d0824da2bc38754e476c84"}

Let\u2019s not forget how we are told time and time again how trends are \u201ccyclical\u201d, that fashion looks \u201ccome and go\u201d. This is the time to make some considered wardrobe-related resolutions rather than being triggered to buy more, more, more\u2026\nMy own resolution is this: to ensure I buy for my own tastes, rather than conforming. I\u2019m determined to buy what I love, not what I feel I\u2019m meant to love. No more \u201cof the moment\u201d trainer styles, no more bad-quality jeans, no more multipacks of stripey tops because the price is \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d... This is a whole new level of pondering before purchase. If my approach seems too extreme, take your lead from these style leaders and their own personal resolutions.\nReduce and refine\n\u201cI started reducing my closet size this year, and it\u2019s very cathartic! In 2025, I\u2019m aiming to keep an even more refined capsule wardrobe of tailored pieces that I wear in a variety of combinations. Lovely oversized blazers, a long burgundy pencil skirt from De Savary, thin cashmere polo-necks layered underneath bigger cable-knit pieces. I\u2019m aiming to accessorise them with 90\u2019s-inspired gold earrings from YSSO and Orelia.\u201d\nLOUISE ROE, presenter and founder of Sharland England\nWhisper of the Wind earrings, \u00a3320, YSSO\nA soup\u00e7on of timeless French chic\n\u201cI find this so hard! I am absolutely obsessed with clothes, a real passion of mine, but I think I would like to add a bit more colour in 2025 and I would like to get out of leggings and change from the gym for the day rather than stay in them! I have always been obsessed with the French look so I am hoping to channel that even more. I have actually been collecting some little neck scarves as I want to wear these a bit more. My whole wardrobe is French-girl-meets-cowboy-in-the-1970s with a touch of 80s thrown in.\u201d\nJOOLS OLIVER, writer and childrenswear designer\nGaston scarf, \u00a325, S\u00e9zane\nSort out your lingerie drawer\n\u201cNew year is the perfect time for a wardrobe detox, starting with your lingerie drawer! Did you know 80 per cent of British women wear the wrong bra size? A well-fitted bra can improve your posture, alleviate back pain, as well as boosting self-confidence and promoting skin health (our Nudea Fit Tape allows you to measure at home and is ideal for checking your size every six months).\n\u201cWith the average British woman owning 20 bras but wearing just five, it\u2019s little wonder 19 million bras end up in landfill annually. That\u2019s why we offer a recycling scheme for old or ill-fitting bras to highlight the importance of responsible shopping.\n\u201cFor a versatile \u2018bra-drobe\u2019, we suggest one nude, one black, and one coloured bra for variety, along with different briefs to avoid VPL (visible panty line) and maximise styling options year-round.\u201d\nPRIYA DOWNES, chief executive officer and founder of Nudea\nThe Boss full cover bra in Bare 07, \u00a348 reduced to \u00a310, Nudea\nDon\u2019t edit out personality\n\u201cI need more personality in my wardrobe. While buying just five things a year is an incredible sartorial (and financial) discipline, I found this year I strayed too far into boring sensible territory. For 2025, three of my items will be outrageous, talking-point pieces! First stop will be A Perfect Nomad, an independent British designer whom we stock in our Ibiza store, AGORA.\nHer designs are relaxed, her fabrics all natural, (her silk hemp mix is gorgeous, durable and breathable), but the finishing is elevated and super cool. I bought a pair of her gold cargos two years ago and they work from Shoreditch to Santa Gertrudis. She is doing a wide leg leather pant this spring which looks ace, and is vegetable-tanned and chrome-free lamb leather. But I also love the look of the black crochet floor length skirt... Could I? Should I?...!\u201d.\nTIFFANIE DARKE, founder of Rule of Five\nLace skirt, \u00a3240, A Perfect Nomad\nInvest in elevated basics to make your wardrobe work harder\n\u201cI\u2019m finally going to invest in one or two excellent pairs of jeans. I wear a With Nothing Underneath (WNU) shirt and jeans most days and have never really taken the time to find the perfect cut, so I\u2019m on the hunt.\n\u201cI have invested in a few pairs of smart boots and hope to kick my trainer habit. I became very lazy in my footwear when it came to outfitting and I am looking forward to elevating my WNU looks with a sharp boot in the start of 2025.\u201d\nPIP DURELL, founder and chief executive officer of With Nothing Underneath\nThe dress shirt, \u00a3175, With Nothing Underneath\nBring a sense of intention (and a planning mindset!) to your work outfits\n\u201cI\u2019m not usually one for fashion resolutions or planning my wardrobe in advance, but with a packed schedule in 2025 (travelling up to two weeks a month) I know I need a wardrobe that supports and empowers me \u2013 rather than becoming the source of frustration.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be leaning into my boyish androgynous side. There\u2019s something about the clean lines of a tailored suit or the sharpness of a smart jacket that instills confidence in me. Next year, as I step into hosting retreats and delivering numerous speaking engagements, I want my wardrobe to amplify that sense of empowerment. I think of suits as more than just clothing; they\u2019re a declaration of intent.\u201d\n\u201cSustainability matters deeply to me, and that means prioritising timeless, high-quality garments over fleeting trends. I now buy fewer pieces, focusing instead on quality and longevity and in 2025, I will purchase only items that I believe will remain a staple in my wardrobe for years.\n\u201cAs for colour? I\u2019ve been known to cycle through entire seasons clad in black, but 2025 will be different. I\u2019ve finally discovered how energising and uplifting color can be, and I\u2019m committed to embracing my favourites \u2013 red, blush cornflower blue and buttermilk. Whilst I\u2019m not big on prints, I do love checks and stripes.\n\u201cEven though I have spent my career in the fashion industry, it is only now that I have come to a profound realisation: my fashion goals need to align with my life goals and my choices in clothing need to embody the same values I strive for in my life \u2013 intentionality, sustainability, and authenticity.\u201d\nDALBIR BAINS, executive coach, entrepreneur and founder of Santalan\nPatch pocket jacket in bluebell, \u00a3850, Victoria Beckham\nIf you do one thing\u2026 add an earcuff\n\u201cA strong ear game can totally change the look of an outfit.

As a mum of a two-year-old and a four-year-old, all my clothes have got some kind of stain before I leave the house, my coat pockets and bags are laden with crumbs, toys, or something random and sticky at the bottom that I find stuck to my laptop as I pull it out in an important meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWhilst I don\u2019t want to hide being a mum at work I would like to feel a little more \u2018together\u2019, so I am purchasing myself a bag, a laptop case, a make-up bag and a pencil case.

For many, it\u2019s breakfast which gets the heave-ho, especially on a time-restricted diet plan which limits the time you can eat to eight or 10 hours a day.\nBut the latest scientific research reveals eating later in the day could lead to weight gain. By ignoring our circadian rhythm \u2013 our internal clock which tells us when to eat and when to sleep \u2013 we\u2019re storing up a host of health problems.\nChrono-fasting is a new wellness trend which aims to bring our eating habits back in line with our body clock. But how does it work?\nWhat is chrono-fasting?\nChrono-fasting is a time-restricted diet based on the principles of chrono-nutrition \u2013 which is \u201cthe study of how our circadian rhythm and nutrition interrelate,\u201d says Rhian Stephenson, a nutritionist and the founder of supplement brand Artah.\nStephenson explains: \u201cOur internal clock, like a master clock, maintains a daily rhythm. This influences essential processes such as hormone release, energy levels, sleep, hunger, repair and regeneration. Our body has distinct functions throughout the day whether it be digestion, problem-solving, physical activity or an ability to respond to stress.\u201d\nThe aim is to eat in the \u201cbiological day\u201d and let the body rest in the \u201cbiological night\u201d. Instead of eating between, for example, 8am and 8pm, eat between an early time-restricted window, having breakfast between 7am and 8am and dinner by 4pm or 5pm. Front-load calories early in the day: eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper, and make sure each meal has a good balance of fibre, protein, fat and phytonutrients.\nA 2022 meta-analysis of studies found dieters who consumed a greater proportion of their calories in the morning lost more weight than those who had more calories at dinner, possibly because of better alignment with their circadian rhythm.\nBenefits of chrono-fasting\n1. It\u2019s better for our metabolic health\nThe same meta-analysis found early eaters had lower levels of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, blood sugar and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, a 2020 meta-analysis of studies found insulin and blood sugar levels were higher after the same meal was eaten between 8pm and 4am, than between 7am and 4pm \u2013 while eating carbs in the evening is known to spike blood sugar levels compared to the morning. All of that means eating early in the day helps with weight loss as we\u2019re less likely to reach for a sugary snack to give ourselves a boost.\n2. It\u2019s better for recovery\nWe all know that sluggish feeling we get in the morning when we\u2019ve gone to bed on a full stomach. Stephenson says: \u201cWhen we sleep, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol and various other hormones allow time for extensive physical and emotional recovery; our muscles, organs and cells repair, our immune system is strengthened, and our cognitive function is restored.\u201d\n3. It\u2019s good for keeping us regular\nThe most common time to empty our bowels is after breakfast. Dr Emma Derbyshire, a public health nutritionist from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, says: \u201cYou are most likely to go to loo in the morning \u2013 waking up triggers gut motility. But if your body clock gets disrupted, it can lead to constipation.\u201d\n4. It\u2019s easier to keep the weight off\nOne 2011 study found that dieters who ate more in the morning continued to lose weight even after coming off their calorie-controlled diet, while those who ate more in the evening put weight back on.\nIs chrono-fasting better than intermittent fasting?\nTime-restricted diets are a type of intermittent fasting. But there are other methods of intermittent fasting such as the 5/2 approach where you eat around 500 calories each day for two days a week. The problem is consuming such a small amount of calories on two days of the week runs counter to the principles of chrono-nutrition \u2013 especially if you save that up for dinner.\nStephenson explains: \u201cChrono-fasting may be helpful for people suffering from chronic stress \u2013 especially perimenopausal females \u2013 because if you wake up and don\u2019t eat until 12, you can exacerbate that stress.\u201d\nPlus, we may actually alter our sleep times if we eat too late. A 2024 German study which compared early and late time-restricted eating found that eating later in the day altered the circadian body clock, causing a delay in sleep timing. Those on the earlier plan also felt hungrier in the morning.\nHow to follow a chrono-fast diet\nEating within a shorter window is known to lower the amount of calories consumed - plus, there\u2019s no snacking in front of the television in the evening. The balance of food you eat is important: a breakfast of cornflakes isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cEvery meal should be high-protein and high in fibre: you\u2019re aiming to get 25g of protein and 20g of fibre into each meal, so you\u2019re still well nourished,\u201d says Stephenson.\nDr Derbyshire reiterates the importance of fibre in our daily diets: \u201cNone of us are eating enough fibre,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all need to get at least 10g more a day.\u201d She suggests oat-based breakfasts with yogurt to boost protein levels and seeds, and making sure you include white meat, fish, eggs or cheese at lunch, alongside fresh veg and salad and wholegrains.\nFor example, 250g of Greek yogurt for breakfast will give you around 25g of protein. Chicken offers 27g of protein per 100g and salmon 25g. Foods with 6g of fibre per 100g are called high-fibre foods and include lentils and wholegrain cereals.\nTips to help with chrono-fasting\nIf you\u2019re a night owl, bring the eating window forward in the day, but consider starting at 10am and finishing at 6pm or at the latest by 7pm. But bear in mind 70 per cent of us are actually \u201cbears\u201d \u2013 neither a lark nor an owl. Plus, says Stephenson, while our chronotype is influenced by our genes, \u201cour circadian rhythm is not, and you can train it \u2013 as we do when we fly to a different time zone\u201d.\nDo it in January. The hours of daylight we currently have match the suggested window of eating perfectly: when it gets dark at 4pm your body will naturally start getting ready for bed. Stephenson says: \u201cAt this time of year people are willing to stop drinking alcohol, one of the biggest disruptors of sleep, circadian rhythm and the gut microbiome.\u201d\nPreparation is key. Eating a good breakfast takes planning and Dr Derbyshire suggests, \u201cPreparing some overnight oats before you go to sleep. Feeling time-poor in the morning is a reason people skip breakfast.\u201d\nWhat to eat for lunch in the office\nIf you are working from home, then making a bigger lunch than usual shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But if you\u2019re in the office and usually eat lunch on the go, Dr Derbyshire suggests, \u201cEither pack a lunch (a light sandwich made with wholemeal bread and packed with protein and salad would work well) or choose a shop-bought salad which has a balance of protein, fibre and a wholegrain like quinoa.\u201d\nPlan your dinner. Having soup at 4pm or 5pm if you\u2019re working in the office can be tricky but make it the night before and take it in a thermos rather than resort to a shop-bought soup. Dr Derbyshire adds: \u201cPlus, it\u2019s good if you are restricting calories in any way to take a multivitamin each day.\u201d\nThe chrono-fast diet plan\nStephenson\u2019s supplement brand Artah is launching its own post-Christmas diet reset diet that lasts for three weeks. Stephenson says: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to lose half a stone following the chrono-fast. The absence of sugar, alcohol, and ultra processed food combined with a focus on fibre, protein, and phytonutrients should lead to weight loss. As long as you\u2019re following the core foods and the meal-timing principles, you\u2019ll get great results. \u201d\nWeeks one and three\nThe average daily calorie intake in weeks one and three is around 1,500-1,600kcal per day, with the option to increase portion size depending on your goals and activity level.\nWeek two\n\u201cCalorie intake during the chrono-fast is between 1,000-1,200kcals. Calorie intake is front-loaded in the day with around 450-550kcal for breakfast and lunch, and then for it\u2019s soup (180kcal) or a broth (50kcal) [depending which plan you\u2019re on]. There\u2019s a \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 mid-way through the week, where people can eat one of our suggested meals in the evening should they need it.\u201d\nFAQs\nHow long does the chrono-fast last?\n\u201cFollow the strict chronofast for seven days only \u2013 and make sure you rest and recover while you do so,\u201d says Stephenson\nCan I drink alcohol on the chrono-fast?\nNo: alcohol disrupts sleep and wreaks havoc on our body clock, so ditch it for this diet.\nWhat if I can\u2019t eat until later?\nIf you can\u2019t do it perfectly, then just do what you can. If you can\u2019t have the soup until 7pm, this is fine as the calories are negligible.\nCan I exercise while I\u2019m doing the seven-day chrono-fast?\nGive a hard training schedule a swerve and focus on a week of yoga and breathwork, plus don\u2019t train hard in the evening. Artah are running on demand and weekly live sessions of yoga as part of the plan.\nIs the chrono-fast a calorie-controlled diet?\nCalorie intake might be lower than your usual diet but Stephenson says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to eat five almonds and a few grapes. It\u2019s about eating good quality meals and understanding how much the timing of what you eat can impact your health.\u201d\nHow can I adapt it to everyday life once I\u2019ve done the fast?\n\u201cYou can follow the principles of chrono-nutrition in your daily life. Aim for eating earlier and to finish eating by 7pm three or four days a week, or at weekends if that\u2019s easier,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stick to it every day \u2013 we all have social lives!\u201d\nRecipes\nProvided by Artah\nBreakfast\nSpiced Shakshuka", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "What is chrono-fasting and can it help with weight loss?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/chrono-fasting/", "id": "27d4e1af0c6daf7bcfa63f2e04f8b2b7809e850028894305687ffa2b968568c9"}

If we watch something, it\u2019s on YouTube or we rent library DVDs.\n\u201cThe heating goes on twice a day to warm the flat to 18.5 degrees. It\u2019s terribly cold at times, but we try to use the principle of heating the person rather than the space.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mobile phone contract. I use pay-as-you-go because it costs me \u00a35.60 per month. I\u2019ve had the same phone for the past eight years. It\u2019s a pain because now it\u2019s really slow and there are certain websites you cannot open any more. But that\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe most valuable things Monica owns are her 10-year-old computer which she worries she cannot afford to replace and their second-hand car which she uses in the summer holidays to go hiking with her children.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any luxuries. We don\u2019t go to the theatre or the cinema, I can\u2019t afford it. I need to save all the money I have so my son can go to his school,\u201d she says.\n\u2018State school wasn\u2019t an option\u2019\nYou might wonder why someone with such little means chooses to spend more than a third of her income on private education. For Monica, the answer comes immediately. The memories of her older daughter\u2019s experience at state school are still raw.\nHer daughter, now aged 20, attended one of Aberdeen\u2019s most successful state schools, an academy that was known for its impressive exam results. However, rather than thriving at the school, her daughter was singled out because of her financial background.\nMonica says: \u201cMost of her classmates came from the totally opposite background with totally different values. They were very wealthy families where children got whatever they wanted.\n\u201cThere were lots of drugs and smoking involved and my daughter just did not feel included and the school did nothing at all.\n\u201cThere was huge peer pressure to have the right mobile phone. She would say \u2018Why can\u2019t I have this jacket or this bag that the others have?\u2019 Why can\u2019t I have these shoes\u2019.\n\u201cAnd I understand that feeling when you are that age. But I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t want to spend \u00a3150 on a pair of trainers.\n\u201cThere was zero support at the school and she left with one qualification because Covid hit. Luckily her life has completely changed since. She\u2019s had so many positive experiences and can see the world is not so bad as it was at that school.\u201d\n\u201820pc rise is a lot to me\u2019\nWhile her daughter is now going to college and has turned her life around, Monica will do everything in her power to make sure her son does not have the same experience.\n\u201cIn mainstream schools they put you in a box. Everybody needs to be the same, to think the same. There is no encouragement for critical thinking,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBut since the second my son started going to his school, he has loved it. I remember we went for a trial day two months before he started and when we left he said \u2018Mum, can I go already tomorrow\u2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half now since he joined and there has not been a single day where he\u2019s said \u2018Mum, I don\u2019t want to go to school\u2019. He is taught in a class of 10 and it\u2019s a wonderful environment.\u201d\nBut despite his success, Monica is stuck. The school told parents earlier this month it would have to raise its fees by 20pc meaning Monica now needs to find \u00a34,032 to keep her son at his school.\n\u201cThe stress of potentially having to uproot my child from school where he is thriving is overwhelmingly sickening, and it\u2019s putting his future, and our stability, at risk.\u201d\nA \u00a3672 increase is relative for everyone. For Sir Keir Starmer, who earns almost 14 times more than Monica, it is roughly equivalent to one day\u2019s wages. But for Monica, who has sacrificed every luxury in life, there is nothing more she can trim from her vigilant budgeting to make up the shortfall.\nLabour\u2019s attack on lower-paid hard workers\nAnd while you might think a low-paid single mother is exactly the type of person Labour claims to represent, it\u2019s the Government\u2019s own policies that have made her predicament worse.\nHer landlord has decided it is no longer viable to let the property and told Monica last month that he has decided to sell the three-bed flat meaning she needs to find somewhere new to live.\nBut despite increased regulation and taxes forcing thousands of landlords out of the market, prices aren\u2019t coming down. Similar properties are up to \u00a3600 more expensive to rent each month than what Monica currently pays and she says the chance of getting a deposit and then a mortgage \u201cin the current circumstances\u201d is impossible.\nThe obvious solution might be to work more hours \u2013 currently, Monica works 14 and a half hours each week. But the cost of childcare is now so expensive she has calculated that if she applied to work full time, she would be left with less money after paying for a childminder to drop off and pick up her son each day.\nFor Monica, the extra work simply doesn\u2019t pay. It means she\u2019s stuck in a choice between downsizing, although the two-bed flats she\u2019s been looking at are between \u00a3850 and \u00a3900 and therefore still more than she\u2019s currently paying, and applying for council housing, which she fears she won\u2019t get.\nThe reality is, Monica isn\u2019t an outlier. Her case as a private school parent is far more common than the Labour government wants to accept.\nAround 90,000 private school pupils come from below-median-income households and a further 116,000 from outside the top two deciles.\nIt is those families that Labour\u2019s VAT raid will disproportionately affect. \u201cI came to this country for a better life,\u201d Monica says. \u201cBut it really isn\u2019t much better any more.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "'I earn \u00a312k and scrimp to send my child to private school", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/scrimp-send-child-private-school-vat-raid-sickening/", "id": "d8e9006d93fc2a7000d3a0addbd67e0f47d579f461fe53a60e827b895561be21"}
