Blair Kinghorn (Scotland)\nWe have not yet seen the best of Kinghorn \u2013 although, after a few errors against the First Nations and Pasifika XV, the Scot was strong off the bench in the second Test and started the third after a delayed start to his tour. A year younger than Hugo Keenan, Kinghorn has the potential to go from strength to strength in the coming years. Playing club rugby at Toulouse always helps, too.\n14. Tommy Freeman (England)\nThere is no reason why Freeman, ever-present in the 2025 Tests, will not end up on the right wing once again in 2029. Quick, strong and aerially astute, he kept his place in the side on the back of his strong showings in the warm-ups rather than excelling in the Tests. But it shows how much credit he had in the bank that Andy Farrell stuck with him. One of the first names on the England team-sheet in an area of real strength.\n13. Ollie Lawrence (England)\nThere is every chance that Jamie Osborne could feature in the midfield, but alongside Tom Jordan and Sam Prendergast the back line would need some ballast; an out-and-out running threat. Lawrence\u2019s chances of touring in 2025 were cruelly ended by an Achilles injury suffered on England duty in the Six Nations, at a time when he had established himself as his country\u2019s premier centre. Aged just 25, there is no reason why that could not continue for another four years.\n12. Tom Jordan (Scotland)\nIn another world, Jordan may well have been a Lion in 2025. Not just with the early injury to Elliot Daly \u2013 Jordan\u2019s ability to cover 10,12 and 15 made him a prime candidate as replacement \u2013 but the Scot must have been in with a shot at making the original squad given his versatility and general excellence. Before a move to Bristol \u2013 if he can nail down a starting spot with Scotland, which will be easier said than done \u2013 he can have every hope of touring the land of his birth in 2029.\n11. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (England)\nAs with Jordan, in another world Feyi-Waboso could have been a Lion this summer. Had injury not put a premature end to his season \u2013 he returned in June only to be sent off and banned in England\u2019s uncapped match against France \u2013 then he would have been right in the selection picture given his strike-running threat and willingness to hit things very hard on both sides of the ball. Maybe, given the signs of rustiness on his June return, he will be better for not going.\n10. Sam Prendergast (Ireland)\nPrendergast was chucked in at the deep end for last year\u2019s Six Nations. It showed he has some maturing and growing to do \u2013 both mentally and physically \u2013 but the talent and potential is palpable. Should he bulk up a touch then there is no reason why he could not tour with the Lions in four years\u2019 time. Had he been in the frame for the 2025 tour, it might well have been for the benefit of his future development that he did not feature.\n9. Alex Mitchell (England)\nAlthough Mitchell featured in every match-day 23 of the 2025 tour, it would be fair to say that he never really grasped the nettle. Jamison Gibson-Park always looked like the Test starter and, before his injury, Tomos Williams looked as if he had the bench spot sewn up, too. Ben White also finished the tour in great form but after another four years of experience Mitchell will surely fancy his chances of achieving something he could not this year: a Test start.\n1. Andrew Porter (Ireland)\nA year younger than Ellis Genge, Porter gets the nod at loosehead. England are starting to unearth some fabulous props who could well end up usurping the Irishman \u2013 who, admittedly, struggled in the final Test \u2013 but Porter has the jersey and so is a sensible choice for 2029. Although the likes of Fin Baxter and Genge might have something to say about that.\n2. Dan Sheehan (Ireland)\nThe easiest pick of the lot. One of the Lions\u2019 outstanding contributors on the 2025 tour who played as well as anyone in the travelling party. Sheehan captained the Lions in an early tour match and, depending on the form and fitness of club-and-country-mate Caelan Doris, he would surely be a candidate to lead more regularly in 2029. One of the world\u2019s outstanding hookers and comfortably the best among the home nations.\n3. Asher Opoku-Fordjour (England)\nGiven his development this season, this could quite easily read Joe Heyes but the frightening thing about Opoku-Fordjour is that he is still just 21 years old. And he plays both sides of the scrum, which is a massive bonus on tour. There are high hopes for Thomas Clarkson, too, after his cameo on the 2025 tour.\n4. Joe McCarthy (Ireland)\nCompletely deserving of another run after impressing this summer. No one would have said that his inclusion was a surprise pre-tour, even if he was susceptible to the odd brain-fade. But the way that he took hold of one of the starting Test jerseys in the second row from his first appearance on tour was commanding and somewhat unexpected. He could easily do the same in four years. Maro Itoje could well be there again, too, but misses out on this selection because of age.\n5. George Martin (England)\nHad injury not severely disrupted the end of Martin\u2019s season, he would have been a shoo-in for the Australia tour. As it was, his last appearance for club or country came in February. If he can get fit and stay fit then his ballast and muscle would offer so much where the Lions currently lack. The tourists (just about) got away with it against Australia, but against better opposition, who knows?\n6. Ollie Chessum (England)\nWith such a heavyweight second row, there would be a real need for a line-out-jumping six. Chessum did his chances of touring in 2029 no harm at all this year, featuring off the bench in two Tests and starting in one. Over the coming years, it looks as though he will become a central part of plans for both club and country, and might even develop into a central leadership figure, too.\n7. Tom Curry (England)\nIt is amazing when you think he is only 27 \u2013 by the time of the next tour he will be 31. There were eyebrows raised when he was selected in the Test team for 2025 but Andy Farrell was clearly aware of his value and his selections were fully vindicated. Expect Jac Morgan to still be knocking on the door, too.\n8. Caelan Doris (Ireland)\nThe forgotten man of this year\u2019s Lions tour and, goodness, how they missed him. Injury this year robbed him of representation, but he may well have been captain \u2013 who knows \u2013 and we can say with certainty that he would have started at No 8. Do not forget, like Curry, he is only 27. It is worth noting, too, that Ben Earl is the same age.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Here is what the 2029 Lions team will look like", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2025/08/05/here-is-what-the-2029-lions-team-will-look-like/", "id": "2bd51d6bc648116a3ce2aec7baa37fa16b1c9b7046149ffb7011379062f3fcc5"}

These are often misguided. Among the more specious are the following:\n1. Chain hotels are soulless, so to be avoided\nNo. Give me a clean room, a comfortable bed, a bath in the bathroom (Lord help us, not the bedroom), lighting I can understand, predictable standards \u2013 and I\u2019ll supply all the soul that\u2019s needed.\n2. Always eat where the locals eat\nWhy? Even in Europe, locals will eat some appalling muck \u2013 or perhaps you\u2019ve never tried Proven\u00e7al pieds-et-paquets or Norwegian rakfisk? And following locals in, say, Hackney might very well lead to jellied eels. How Bolivian visitors will curse you for that bit of advice.\n3. Never order a full English breakfast in foreign parts\nWhy ever not? Look around you. Japanese people seek out Japanese restaurants in London; Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz both favour Spanish restaurants near Wimbledon; Italians pile into trattorie all over the world. So eggs, bacon and the full floor show are not merely allowed but positively recommended in the morning sun of Torremolinos. It\u2019s the finest possible setting for the best breakfast in the world. Be proud, and demand brown sauce.\n4. Keep off the beaten track\nWrong. The track is beaten because there\u2019s something worthwhile at the end of it. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be beaten. Stay off the beaten track and you\u2019ll likely end up somewhere no-one wants to go: Chernobyl, North Korea, Roubaix, Northampton, that sort of place.\n5. Airline meals are dreadful\nReally? You\u2019re moving at 550mph, 35,000 feet above the ground\u2026 and you\u2019re complaining about the state of the lasagne?\n6. You mustn\u2019t use knives and forks for Chinese food, or spaghetti\nOh yes, you must. Thin sticks are uniquely ill-designed for the eating of rice and noodles. Only a totalitarian society would insist on them. Meanwhile, the Italian requirement that spaghetti be not cut but twirled is just another of their ways \u2013 coffee invisible to the naked eye, Mario Balotelli, the Mafia \u2013 of annoying the world. Chop it up, for heaven\u2019s sake \u2013 it tastes the same and doesn\u2019t stain \u2013 and, when Chinese or Italians come to Britain, demand they eat their fish and chips with a brick.\n7. Always avoid other Britons on holiday\nWhy on earth? We\u2019re usually pretty decent; also the only ones who can maintain a conversation about the pension triple lock, Bonnie Blue, Port Vale FC, roadworks on the A59, the mystery of London\u2019s parakeets or the legacy of Ozzy Osbourne. Spaniards in a Spanish bar are no more interested in talking to you if you don\u2019t speak Spanish than you are interested in talking to monoglot Slovenians down your local pub. Also you are the other Britons to other Britons, so need to leave wherever you are as soon as other Britons show up, so as not to torpedo their holiday.\n8. We got on marvellously, though we had no common language\nNo. You thought you got by with signs and smiles. You didn\u2019t. As you expressed admiration for Volodymyr Zelensky, so they understood you were inviting them for a fortnight back in Peterborough.\n9. In France, you don\u2019t order a well-done steak or a caf\u00e9 au lait in mid-afternoon\nYes you do, if you want to. You\u2019re the customer, Gaspard is the waiter. He disapproves? So what? If he was so great, he\u2019d be sitting where you are and you\u2019d be serving him.\n10. We support sustainable tourism\nTerrific. Go to Southend. Or Blackpool. Or Nice. They\u2019ve all sustained tourism since the late 18th century.\n11. We\u2019re not tourists, we\u2019re travellers\nNo, you\u2019re not. If you leave home for leisure, you\u2019re a tourist. \u201cTravellers\u201d are merely tourists with ideas above their station and odd headgear. There\u2019s no moral or qualitative hierarchy of holiday experiences. Flying to Alicante is in no way inferior to flying to Ulaanbaatar. It\u2019s just a different departure gate.\n12. We always try to soak up local culture\nDangerous. Flamenco is occasionally OK, as is tango in Buenos Aires. That said, fado in Lisbon, dirndl skirts in Bavaria and any folk dancing anywhere have the same effect on a holiday as a colonoscopy.\n13. We never stoop to fast food outlets\nBelieve me, you would \u2013 if you saw the alternatives in some resorts I could mention. Put it this way: thank heavens for KFC in Fleetwood, Lancs.\n14. We never fly Ryanair \u2013 they treat passengers like cattle\nNo, they don\u2019t. Look around you again. It\u2019s mainly the passengers who behave like cattle. Ryanair staff undoubtedly take vows of patience. Were I faced with shuffling hordes trying to cram a ton of hand luggage into the overhead locker and a gallon of gin and tonic down their throats, I\u2019d be roaring down the aisle, kicking travellers right and left towards the emergency exits. Which I\u2019d open.\n15. We don\u2019t buy tourist tat\nA pity. Gift shops, their owners and families depend on you buying a small cuckoo clock or plate featuring a bloke in lederhosen blowing an alpenhorn and emblazoned \u201cAndenken aus Deutschland\u201d.\n16. Sorry, but we don\u2019t do lying-about-on-the-beach holidays\nYes, we get it; you\u2019re way too cultivated for that, way too clever to relax with a book and your family and a glass of ros\u00e9 and maybe some friends and maybe also a leisurely dip and laughter and a chance to educate the kids (\u201cHow do crabs have babies?\u201d \u201cSideways\u201d) and the sort of relaxation you always say you hanker for, don\u2019t have time at home.

Southern beaches tend to be livelier and more surf-oriented, backed by vibrant restaurants and bars; meanwhile, the butter-coloured beaches of the less developed central and north-east coasts exude calm.\nThe beaches in Sri Lanka wax and wane seasonally, particularly on the south-west coast during unsettled monsoon months, when sea currents strengthen and change. Very few beaches have lifeguards, so you must always be vigilant by the water\u2019s edge. Endangered marine turtles come ashore throughout the year to nest, and many coastal stretches are wildlife hotspots.\nAll our recommendations below have been hand-selected and tested by our resident destination expert to help you discover the best beaches in Sri Lanka. Find out more below, or for more Sri Lanka inspiration, see our guides to the best hotels, restaurants, bars and things to do.\nFind beaches by area:\nWest coast\nSouth coast\nEast coast\nWest coast\nVentura Beach, Bentota\nBentota is a well-established family-friendly resort town on the west coast, with large hotels (some of which have lifeguard lookouts), soft champagne-coloured sand, blushing sunsets and an adjacent river for windsurfing, jet-skiing and boat rides into mangrove caves. The majority of the restaurants and bars in the area are hotel-based.\nInsider tip: Boutique hotel The Villa Bentota by KK Collection is positioned on Bentota\u2019s quieter, southern shore.\nHow to get there: There are trains to Bentota or the nearby Ahangama station.\nSawukku Beach, Alankuda\nNorthwesterly Kalpitiya is an arid 20-mile-long peninsula flanked by the vast Puttalam Lagoon. Around mid-way up is Alankuda\u2019s unspoilt, under-the-radar, fir-fringed Sawukku beach, dotted with low-key eco resorts. In winter, you can swim, snorkel and kayak; in summer, the offshore wind creates the perfect conditions for kite surfing.\nInsider tip: Book kayaks, paddleboards and dolphin-watching trips from Bar Reef Resort.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s a three-hour drive from Bandaranaike International Airport.\nReturn to index\nSouth coast\nKabalana Beach\nKabalana is part of the south coast\u2019s fast-growing surf scene. Between late November and April, this 500-metre-long sandy bay, backed by guesthouses and boutique hotels (including The Sandhya and Mosvold Villa), attracts surfers to its two main breaks and bodyboarders to its sandy shallows. Sunsets are epic, and there are a variety of restaurants nearby.\nInsider tip: Book high-quality surfboards in advance from The Board Shop, a travelling rental company currently based in the neighbouring town Ahanghama.\nHow to get there: The beach is next to the main Galle-Matara road.\nWeligama Beach\nWeligama\u2019s deep bay is synonymous with southern surfing as the rolling sandy-bottomed breaks are gentle for those looking to learn. Little shacks offering boards for hire and lessons line a strip between the beach and main road, alongside open-air fish markets and catamarans. The water is calmer further west, beyond Taprobane Island.\nInsider tip: Take a tuk tuk (five minutes\u2019 drive) to secluded Jungle Beach (or Walliwala), a lovely quiet cove for seasonal paddling below the luxury hotel Cape Weligama.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s right by the Galle Road, and there\u2019s a train station in Weligama.\nMawella Beach\nMawella\u2019s one-and-a-half-mile-long sandy beach is secreted well away from the busy southern coastal road and has seen mercifully little development. Private villas and small boutique hotels, like The Last House, share this hallowed space with fisherfolk and nesting marine turtles. There are rolling waves (fun for bodyboarding), but you can usually swim year-round.\nInsider tip: Rent kayaks, bodyboards and paddleboards from Halcyon Mawella\nHow to get there: It\u2019s five miles from Tangalle, and the closest train station is Beliatta.\nHiriketiya Beach\nHiriketiya\u2019s sandy beach curves deeply between two prominent headlands near the southern fishing town of Tangalle, and is a favourite with surf-loving digital nomads. It\u2019s a popular (often busy) yet easygoing year-round swimming spot, known for its two surf breaks, profusion of boho-chic coffee shops, vegan cafes, guesthouses and yoga studios.\nInsider tip: Watch the surfing action unfold from sunset-facing cocktail bar Raa.\nHow to get there: Turn off at Dodampahala Junction, between Dickwella and Tangalle.\nDalawella\nThe translucent lagoon protected by an offshore reef in front of Wijeya Beach restaurant is a rare seasonal swimming spot popular with paddlers, with the bonus of resident green turtles and sunsets silhouetted by \u201cThe Frog Rock\u201d. It\u2019s very popular, though the beach slims significantly during the summer months.\nInsider tip: Wijeya Beach is an iconic spot for wood-fired pizzas and sundowners.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s less than two miles southeast of Unawatuna.\nReturn to index.\nEast coast\nKalkudah Beach\nKarpaha Sands is just one of two high-end places to stay along this staggeringly pristine 11-mile beach with swimming on Sri Lanka\u2019s quieter east coast, far from the main road, beyond palm and cashew nut plantations. It\u2019s pin-drop peaceful and totally secluded.\nInsider tip: Watch the daily ritual of \u201cmadella\u201d fishing, where giant nets are cast into the sea every morning and pulled out later by a cooperative of sarong-clad fishermen.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s complicated! Take a tuk tuk (10 minutes) from nearby Pasikuda.\nPasikuda Beach\nPowdery blonde sand, azure water and very calm waves make this crescent-shaped east coast beach one of Sri Lanka\u2019s finest and best for swimming. Families are drawn to the large resorts lining the bay, including Uga Bay, and the variety of water-focused activities, such as jet skiing, water skiing, banana boating, kayaking, paddleboarding and sunset sailing trips.\nInsider tip: Get your snorkelling fix at nearby Kayankerni Marine Sanctuary.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s a 45-minute drive north of Batticaloa\u2019s domestic airport.\nNilaveli\nYou can wade out for a good 50 metres through the calm, clear water from the sandy shore of this laid-back north-easterly beach near Trincomalee, where roaming cows are often seen plodding along the sand. In the distance lies the silhouette of snorkelling hotspot Pigeon Island, a protected marine park.\nInsider tip: Book whale watching or sunset sails through Sail Lanka Charter.\nHow to get there: Nilaveli is a 25-minute drive north of Trincomalee.\nArugam Bay\nSurfers love rugged \u201cA Bay\u201d for its peeling right-handers, consistent swell and lively party scene, yet it\u2019s still a fishing village at heart \u2013 catamarans line the palm-fringed beach while fishermen wrapped in sarongs mend nets under the hot tropical sun. Hostels and guesthouses abound (one standout is Hideaway), and the dining scene is increasingly varied.\nInsider tip: Rent boards or organise surf lessons from Mambo\u2019s Surf School.\nHow to get there: It\u2019s south of Pottuvil, and the beach runs parallel to the main road.\nReturn to index\nHow we choose\nEvery beach in this curated list has been expertly chosen by our destination expert, to provide you with their insider perspective.

There were very real and very credible threats on her life.\n\u201cThere were real fears inside Tallahassee that they could not guarantee her safety, which is why she was moved.\u201d\nMaxwell \u2018could be a flight risk\u2019\nHowell, who self-surrendered in July to serve her sentence at FPC Bryan, has a daughter who was trafficked as a teenager.\nIn an email sent from prison about Maxwell\u2019s transfer, she wrote: \u201cI am honestly shocked she was moved to a federal prison camp with her history and charges.\u201d\nThe married mother-of-four said that her daughter was repeatedly trafficked from the age of 17, leading to her being \u201cbeaten, choked and eventually shot\u201d.\nHer daughter also allegedly became pregnant as a result and Howell said she has since adopted the child.\nThe former professor, who worked in children\u2019s education for 22 years, said she helped the FBI and local law enforcement agencies track down the perpetrators, who are now serving federal prison sentences of more than 20 years.\n\u201cThat incident changed the trajectory of my daughter\u2019s life, as well as mine,\u201d she said.\nHowell said that the circumstances surrounding her daughter being shot provoked her mental health spiral and addiction to gambling, which she funded by resorting to theft.\nIn January, she pleaded guilty to stealing almost $1m from Tarleton State University, her former employer, between 2022 and 2024. She was sentenced to one year in prison in June.\nHowell said: \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone else for the actions that brought me to FPC Bryan, but I can definitely say that the circumstances that surrounded my daughter being shot were what sparked my spiral and addiction to gambling to escape my reality.\n\u201cHaving Ms Maxwell here triggered all of those feelings.\u201d\nHowell also warned that Maxwell could be a flight risk, given her previous efforts to avoid detection prior to her arrest.\nShe said: \u201cThis is a camp you can literally walk out of. I don\u2019t care how many people she turns in, it doesn\u2019t take away from her actions.\n\u201cAs a mother of a sex-trafficking victim, I\u2019m absolutely disgusted she\u2019s in this facility.

"language": "en", "localpath": null, "maintext": "The US is scrambling to get hold of the rare earth metals needed to make weapons after China slashed its supply to American defence firms.\nPrices of some rare earths have increased more than 60-fold after Beijing restricted the export of the materials for defence purposes earlier this year, amid a trade war with the US.\nBeijing controls around 90 per cent of the world\u2019s rare metal supply and dominates the production of many other critical minerals, giving the country a \u201cstranglehold\u201d on the US defence industrial base, experts said.\nA senior defence industry source told The Telegraph the \u201clight is turning from yellow to red\u201d when it comes to American companies\u2019 ability to source the materials, that are needed for everything from fighter jets and drones, to missile-targeting and defensive satellites.\nThe strain on rare earths has exposed how reliant the US is on Chinese exports for its defence supply chain, giving Beijing leverage at a time of fraught trade discussions between the two rival powers.\nA spokesman for the China select committee labelled the situation a \u201cwake-up call\u201d that \u201cunderscores just how dangerous our current dependencies are\u201d.\n\u201cThe United States cannot afford to have defence supply chains at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d they said. \u201cCongress and the administration must now urgently work together to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities before they cost American lives.\u201d\n\u2018No quick and easy fix\u2019\nMichal Sobolick, a senior fellow specialising in United States\u2013China relations at Hudson Institute, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve traded with this authoritarian, Marxist regime and they now have a stranglehold on our ability to make fighter jets.\n\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous and there is no quick and easy fix for this.\u201d\nIn addition to restrictions on rare earths, since December China has banned exports to the US of germanium, gallium and antimony, which are critical minerals used in the making of bullets and night vision goggles.\nSome companies have warned of imminent cuts to production unless fresh supplies of minerals arrive soon.\nOn Wednesday, the chief executive of US-based Leonardo DRS said the firm has been forced to tap into its \u201csafety stock\u201d of germanium.\n\u201cIn order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half [of 2025],\u201d Bill Lynn said on a conference call, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\nThe mineral is used in infrared sensors that guide missiles and other equipment.\nTwo-month delivery delays\nDrone manufacturers are said to be among the most exposed defence firms as they are often small businesses that do not have the kind of stockpiles of rare earths that larger companies do.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2026we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,\u201d Dak Hardwick, the vice-president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, told the WSJ.\nSince China introduced export licences for rare earths in April, defence firms have been required to fill out extensive paperwork, including providing sensitive information such as product images, to ensure the material is not used for military purposes, Western buyers told the WSJ.\nThis has led to delivery delays of up to two months, with one drone manufacturing company reporting that its Chinese magnet supplier had demanded drawings of products, a list of buyers and assurances they would not be used for military applications.\n\u201cOf course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,\u201d Chris Thompson, the vice-president of global sales for ePropelled, told the Journal.\nThe company builds motors for drones used in the Ukraine conflict.\nDoD boosting production of minerals\nMetal importers told the WSJ that Beijing\u2019s demands to know what rare earths are being used means that licences are not being approved for traders to stockpile supplies.\nThe department of defence has moved \u201cat warp speed\u201d in recent months to boost production of critical minerals, according to Dr Gracelin Baskaran, the director of the critical minerals security programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies\nThis included a $400m investment earlier this month in MP Materials, which operates the largest rare earth mine in the Americas. As part of the deal, the company plans to scale its annual magnet manufacturing capacity from 1,000 metric tons in 2025 to 10,000 metric tons over the next decade.\nLast year, the Pentagon also set up the Critical Minerals Forum, which helps metal miners secure funding for rare earth extraction and enables larger defence firms to purchase the materials directly rather than relying on smaller subsidiaries.\n\u201cThe modern age is powered by rare earth elements, and if we don\u2019t move aggressively to solve this problem, we are always going to be playing catchup,\u201d an industry source said.\nMr Sobolick warned that the US has \u201csleepwalked into this situation\u201d and that China\u2019s dominance of the rare metals supply chain will give them the upper hand in trade negotiations over the next few years.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "US defence firms scrambling for rare earth minerals after China blocks exports", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/04/us-defence-firms-scrambling-rare-earth-minerals-chian-block/", "id": "93658a92039bd84cff61ea6fa8096bdc74fbba6bdd815e7c644f6a0b6c5ed331"}

It needs a governor who will fight for you and your values.\u201d\nA flurry of sharp-tongued Fox News appearances, combined with regular clips of her more controversial statements going viral, have transformed Ms Mace into one of the most recognisable congresswomen of Mr Trump\u2019s second term, sparking outrage and admiration in equal measure across the aisle.\nYet one former adviser warned that her metamorphosis may be exposed under the pressures of a gubernatorial campaign.\nBrendan Donehue, a South Carolina-based political strategist who fired Ms Mace as a client, said: \u201cAs soon as South Carolina voters realise that her record does not match her rhetoric, she\u2019s going to be plummeting in the polls.\u201d\nSydney Long, Ms Mace\u2019s press secretary, said: \u201cThe reason Nancy Mace is leading the governor\u2019s race this early is voters know she stands with them, not political insiders afraid of losing their grip on power.\u201d\nThe South Carolina representative made headlines in November last year when she introduced a bill to ban transgender people from using women\u2019s bathrooms in Congress.\nAsked by reporters if the bill was designed to target Sarah McBride, the Delaware representative who became the first transgender person elected to Congress, Ms Mace did not mince her words: \u201cYes\u2026and then some.\u201d\nIn the days after filing the bill, she capitalised on the attention by posting about bathrooms more than 300 times on X, including a clip in which she held up a sign saying \u201cbiological\u201d outside a women\u2019s lavatory on Capitol Hill.\nThe bill sparked outrage among Democrats, who accused her of bullying Ms McBride, encouraged former staff members to denounce her, and triggered protests, with Ms Mace later pictured wearing a sling after she claimed to have been assaulted by a trans rights campaigner.\nUnabashed, Ms Mace doubled down on her stance, repeatedly referring to transgender people as \u201ctrannies\u201d \u2013 including at a congressional hearing \u2013 in an unapologetic effort to stoke controversy, and on Thursday reshared an image of herself superimposed with the caption: \u201cMost prominent transphobe in American politics.\u201d\n\u201cWe approve of this message,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYour mental illness is not our reality.\u201d\nThe bathroom campaign has positioned her at the centre of the Trump administration\u2019s wholesale crackdown on so-called \u201cgender ideology extremism\u201d, helping to cultivate an image of her as a straight-talking new darling of the Right.\nYet it marks a sharp departure from her past position, having told the Washington Examiner in 2021: \u201cI strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,\u201d adding: \u201cNo one should be discriminated against.\u201d\nIt is not the only issue on which Ms Mace has changed her views.\nHaving briefly served in the state House, in 2020 she became the first Republican woman elected to represent South Carolina in Congress, flipping the 1st District after a single term with a Democratic representative.\nAs a single mother who was unafraid to speak her mind, she seemed exactly like the sort of tough-talking Republican who could lead the GOP beyond Mr Trump.\nIndeed, she urged lawmakers to \u201chold the president accountable\u201d for the Jan 6 Capitol riot and said Mr Trump\u2019s legacy had been \u201cwiped out\u201d.\nHer harsh words drew the ire of the president, who called Ms Mace \u201can absolutely terrible candidate\u201d who has been \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the Republican Party and endorsed her primary challenger when she ran for re-election in 2022.\nBut as the party embraced its former leader ahead of the 2024 election, so too did Ms Mace, who endorsed him in January last year, writing on X that it had been a \u201ccomplete s\u2014 show since he left the White House\u201d.\nMs Mace also earned admiration after speaking up about the sexual abuse she had been subjected to, experiences which she says inform her view on women\u2019s only spaces.\nAfter being raped as a teenager, Ms Mace dropped out of high school and worked at Waffle House while studying for her diploma.\nShe went on to become the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, a prestigious military academy.\nIn February, in a harrowing hour-long speech on the House floor, she accused her ex-fiance, Patrick Bryant, and his business associates of raping her and other incapacitated women.\nShe also claimed to have found non-consensual pictures and videos of herself and other women naked and engaged in sex acts.\nThe blame for failing to imprison Mr Bryant, she said, lay with South Carolina\u2019s top prosecutor, Alan Wilson, who allegedly slow-walked any investigation into the men after she presented him with evidence.\nMr Bryant denied the allegations in a comment to AP, while Mr Wilson\u2019s office labelled Ms Mace\u2019s claims \u201ccategorically false\u201d and said it had not received \u201cany reports or requests for assistance\u201d regarding the case.\nIn a strange twist, Mr Wilson will be Ms Mace\u2019s primary opponent in the gubernatorial race.\nA recent poll showed Ms Mace leading the pack with 16 per cent of support among Republican voters before entering the contest.\nThat puts her one point ahead of Mr Wilson, with Lieutenant governor Pamela Evette, House representative Ralph Norman and State Senator Josh Krimbell sweeping up the remaining votes.\nPrior to launching her campaign, Ms Mace had already declared it a \u201ctwo-man race\u201d and engaged in some pre-emptive bashing of her key rival.\n\u201cThis is a two-man race, if I get in, between me and Alan Wilson, the South Carolina attorney general, who likes to put paedophiles on trial and give them one day in jail serve,\u201d she said.\nMs Mace may be the most recognisable face in the race, but Mr Donehue said that the contest remains wide open with more than a year to go until election day.\nThat length of time, he predicted, will give voters a chance to decide which of Ms Mace\u2019s personas they believe.", "source_domain":

A few hundred miles away in north London, a women\u2019s team with no clubhouse meets on borrowed ground. In Essex, a rugby club battles football for visibility. The circumstances differ, but the message is the same \u2013 women\u2019s rugby is growing and the game must make space for it.\nAcross England, rugby clubs are transforming how women and girls access the game, and not just by forming teams, but by rethinking space, visibility and community.\nThe recipients of the Telegraph Media Group Honda Rugby Legacy Fund are showing what this sort of progress looks like from the grassroots up. And the Telegraph Media Group/Honda partnership brought 15 of their prize-fund winners together one fine summer\u2019s day to celebrate and share their stories.\nThe three featured here \u2013 from south Bristol, north London and Essex \u2013 are proving that when space is made, both physically and socially, women and girls rush to fill it.\nBreaking barriers in Bristol\nFounded in 2022 with just 12 players, South Bristol Girls has grown as the city\u2019s sole girls-only rugby club. With increased numbers expected next season, the demand is high, but space is not.\n\u201cOur challenge is around the number of girls we\u2019ve got,\u201d says head coach Luke Summerfield. \u201cWe have fairly limited facilities at our club at the moment. We\u2019re very restricted, especially in the winter months, in terms of the space to be able to train in. At the moment it\u2019s in a very compact area, but we\u2019re expecting 80 girls next season so we need to expand the training area. Buying mobile floodlights would really help.\u201d\nThe club also relies on external support to meet basic needs. \u201cMany of our girls rely on local charities to afford the basics \u2013 kit, boots and transport.\u201d\nTheir \u00a31,000 award will help them provide mobile floodlighting and essential kit support \u2013 a change Summerfield hopes will extend their reach. \u201cHopefully, the publicity from having been part of this celebration event will be great to show to the local community, and hopefully draw some new girls into the club as well,\u201d he says.\nUnity without walls in north London\nHampstead Women\u2019s Plus, founded more than 20 years ago, doesn\u2019t have its own clubhouse or training ground, but what it lacks in facilities it makes up for in camaraderie and commitment.\n\u201cI think in terms of those here today, we might be the only rugby club that doesn\u2019t actually have a clubhouse,\u201d says Maggie Simpson, one of the club\u2019s players. \u201cSo we have a challenge of bringing our community into one place.\u201d\nStill, she sees opportunity in that challenge. \u201cWe are not tied to a clubhouse, but we can do lots of other things, lots of other events.\u201d\nThe club will use its \u00a31,000 grant to revive a once-thriving girls\u2019 section. \u201cWe had a girls\u2019 team that was quite strong pre-Covid. Post-Covid some of the girls were getting older and going to university and we didn\u2019t have the younger girls coming through,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cWhat we want to do with the fund is to grow our girls team again \u2013 help with marketing, going into schools, getting more girls who don\u2019t have a rugby club already, getting them involved.\u201d\nFellow player Ellie Sneesby, who is also the club\u2019s sponsorship officer, says she is passionate about what rugby offers: \u201cRugby has transformed my life, because it\u2019s given me a whole new group of friends. I\u2019m incredibly active now and I just think that rugby is for every woman and everybody. An older girl can play and a small girl can play and it really is a sport for every single person.\u201d\nReframing rugby in Essex\nIn Harlow, where it\u2019s football that dominates the local sports scene, Harlow Ladies is using its \u00a33,000 grant to widen the rugby tent.\n\u201cWe have a lot of clubs in the local area that we can link up with, and we support each other,\u201d says club captain Emma Warr. \u201cHowever, there is room for growth \u2013 not only increasing the number of players that we have across the girls section, the women\u2019s section, but also growing the footprint we have in women\u2019s coaching, refereeing and officiating.\u201d\nThe club will invest in coaching and referee development, as well as a player support fund for essentials such as boots and scrum caps.\n\u201cRugby means community to me,\u201d Warr said. \u201cMy rugby team is a family, sometimes dysfunctional, but we all support each other.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling at training, if you\u2019re struggling in a game, they\u2019ll pick you up. If you\u2019re struggling in life, they\u2019ll pick you up as well.\u201d\nAcross these three clubs it is clear that rugby is effective as a vehicle for belonging, empowerment and growth. Whether it\u2019s the sole girls-only set-up in Bristol, a nomadic north London side or an Essex team redefining access, these clubs are shaping the future of the game \u2013 one determined player at a time.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Rethinking grassroots women's rugby UK", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/powering-england-rugby/bristol-hampstead-harlow/", "id": "be8b2788dfdcc3bcbfff0a5eecbd588e12911e7d990736c6acedb7728f76cf21"}

The day also allowed the clubs to share stories and discuss how they might overcome the challenges they each face.\nFor grassroots teams like Tetbury, Ivybridge and Torquay, the fund is helping to turn outdated, often male-dominated facilities into inclusive, welcoming spaces where girls can thrive not only as players, but as officials, teammates and leaders.\nLetting in the light\nIn rural Gloucestershire, Tetbury RFC has grown from a single U12 girls\u2019 team in 2021 to nearly 70 players across all age groups, with their first U18 team launching next season. But their facilities have not kept pace with their growth. They have been awarded a \u00a33,000 fund to help level that playing field.\n\u201cOur unique challenge is space \u2013 we only have one pitch to play on,\u201d says coach Mark Benfield. \u201cWe could use floodlights to make use of the space around the pitch. To have some extra lights means we can have more girls coming in, making it a safe environment for them and utilising our space better. Then, hopefully, they can bring their friends and have more fun.\u201d\nThe spirit of the fund was on display during the Honda winners\u2019 day. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat here,\u201d adds Leon Horton, another coach at Tetbury. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to give the girls huge amounts of energy, give them a lovely outcome and have a fun time doing it, meeting new friends.\u201d\nChanging up\nIn Devon, Ivybridge RFC has seen its women\u2019s section double in size since 2020 and it now supports more than 100 girls in weekly training. With two players recently representing England and Scotland at U18 level, the club has performance as well as participation in its sights \u2013 but facilities are again a limiting factor; something that they hope to address with their \u00a31,000 award.\n\u201cOur club\u2019s challenge is the changing rooms,\u201d says Georgina Robinson, women\u2019s player and girls\u2019 coach. \u201cThey\u2019re very much designed \u2013 and the club has been designed \u2013 for men\u2019s rugby over the years and now we\u2019ve introduced women and girls. We need to make the changing rooms and the facilities generally more female friendly.\u201d\nThe club is also deeply community focused, offering lifts, boots and support to families in a town where nearly 70 per cent of households live with some form of deprivation. Under-14s coach Nikki Moss adds: \u201cBeing here today is such a privilege and I\u2019m really proud that we got selected from lots of entries as a small club in Devon. The money will really help support our women and girls\u2019 rugby at the club in terms of changing some of our facilities and just generally providing equipment for the girls.\u201d\nWhole new ball game\nTorquay Athletic RFC, also in Devon, is starting from scratch \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely what makes its progress so exciting. This is the club\u2019s first ever women and girls section, and it has begun with a focus on T1, the new non-contact version of the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Lucy Callaghan, youth and minis coach at the club. \u201cWe are so delighted to bring girls into Torquay and it\u2019s been a really exciting journey this year. We were amazed with the numbers and how it\u2019s grown, and the support we\u2019ve got from other clubs.\u201d\nTo avoid pulling players from neighbouring teams, the club made the conscious decision to start with non-contact rugby. \u201cWhat\u2019s been really interesting is that by doing the non-contact version, it\u2019s brought in numbers, and now some of those are saying they\u2019d like to start contact rugby. So, we\u2019ve built it from the ground up without competing with those other clubs around us for numbers.\u201d\nNow the club wants to use its \u00a31,000 award to invest in match official development for girls \u2013 but their current facilities are far from suitable. \u201cWe want to improve our match officials\u2019 facility so that girls are far more likely to want to become a match official because the facilities are going to be great for them instead of the dingey things that we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d adds Jackie Coles, women\u2019s lead at the club.\n\u201cThe fund will improve our facilities, especially one of the bathrooms. We\u2019re going to be moving the facilities around to the front of the building, with women and girls in mind. It\u2019s all about safety and feeling confident in the space. We\u2019ve got some girls who are 16 saying they want to be referees. I\u2019m not sending them around the back of the clubhouse.\u201d\nAcross all three clubs, the message is clear. Inclusion is not just about who is invited to play \u2013 it\u2019s about whether the facilities say, \u201cYou belong here.\u201d With the support of the Telegraph Media Group Honda Rugby Legacy Fund, these grassroots sides are making sure the answer is a resounding yes.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Transforming facilities For UK women's rugby", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/powering-england-rugby/tetbury-ivybridge-torquay/", "id": "154f0f54e66258c79ee1a0dbb1ed816bc0881d9e856d786f4da703dabfd79bd7"}

The anger and grief are overwhelming.\n\u201cBut I went up [to the Temple Mount] to remember \u2013 and to promise. To promise leadership that unites, that heals, and that protects the next generation.\u201d\nYisrael Katz, Israel\u2019s defence minister, visited the Western Wall, saying the Temple Mount was again under Israeli sovereignty after 2,000 years.\nHe said: \u201cIsrael haters around the world continue to make decisions against us and protest, and we will strengthen our hold and sovereignty over Jerusalem, at the Western Wall, and the Temple Mount, forever.\u201d\nIt is not against the status quo agreement for Jews to visit the Al-Aqsa mosque, only to pray there.\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, called on the international community and US to intervene \u201cimmediately to put an end to the crimes of the settlers and the provocations of the extreme Right-wing government in Al-Aqsa Mosque, stop the war on the Gaza Strip and bring in humanitarian aid\u201d.\nJordan condemned Mr Ben-Gvir\u2019s prayer as \u201can unacceptable provocation, and a reprehensible escalation.\u201d\nIsrael has \u201cno sovereignty over the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque\u201d, Jordan added.\nAbout 1,200 Jews visited the Temple Mount on Sunday according to the Waqf, the authority which manages Islamic buildings at the site.\nThe Temple Mount has been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Jordan is the custodian of the site, but Israel controls security around it.\nPalestinians and Israeli police force often clash there, especially during Ramadan and Passover, when religious Jews visit.\nUltra-nationalist religious Jews have sought to regain full control of the entire site, while Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters have attacked Israeli police forces from the site.\nHamas has often said that the Al-Aqsa compound/Temple Mount was a red line, vowing to \u201cliberate\u201d all of Jerusalem through jihad.\nThe Oct 7 massacre was also named the \u201cAl-Aqsa flood\u201d by the terror group.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "title": "Israeli minister flouts 1967 agreement by praying at Al-Aqsa mosque compound", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/03/israel-minister-flouts-1967-deal-praying-al-aqsa-mosque/", "id": "cb429704a618f23d03e40c352c8714c14ea57f51639a1ee1faeff8296628af77"}

With these landslides it is not secure. He was really afraid.\u201d\nPhotos of the signage posted on the alpine service\u2019s Facebook page read: \u201cWarning.

As it stands, shadow fleet vessels regularly cross through the territorial waters of Western nations.\nMany fly so-called \u201cflags of convenience\u201d, such as Comoros or Gabon, in an attempt to obscure their participation in funding the Russian war machine.\nThe SVR report went on to state that London could also encourage Kyiv to set fire to a tanker in a port in a \u201cstate friendly to Russia.\u201d\nAt least six tankers have been hit with mysterious explosions since the start of the year. Suspicion for the attacks has fallen on Ukraine, as all the tankers had docked in Russian ports and some were carrying Russian oil.\nThe US and EU sanctions regime against Russia\u2019s shadow fleet has started to seriously impact its operations.\nAccording to the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank, the volume of oil carried on its vessels has fallen from more than 50 million barrels per month to less than 20 million per month since the start of the year.\nMoscow has previously signalled its anger at the growing restrictions on the vessels by escorting them with military jets, the first time it explicitly acknowledged the shadow fleet as linked to its national security.\nThe SVR report says: \u201cThe impetus for such a campaign, according to London\u2019s plan, should be given by a resonant incident with one or several tankers.\n\u201cThe plan provides for the organisation of a major sabotage, the damage from which will make it possible to declare the transportation of Russian oil a threat to all international shipping.\n\u201cThis will untie the West\u2019s hands in choosing methods of counteraction.\u201d\nThe claimed attack plans could be a desperate attempt to deter Donald Trump from following through on his threat to enact 100 per cent tariffs on Russia and countries which buy fossil fuel from Moscow. On Monday, Mr Trump said he was set to impose harsh tariffs on India for continuing to purchase Russian oil.\nFighterbomber, a Russian war blogger, said: \u201cthe countermeasures here are very simple.
